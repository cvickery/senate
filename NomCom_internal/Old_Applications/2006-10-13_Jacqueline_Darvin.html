  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am a new Academic Senator-at-Large representing the Division of Education. I am
  a faculty member in the SEYS Department and prior to coming to Queens College in 2004, I was a secondary school teacher for
  twelve years. I am the recipient of the 2006 QC President's Award for Innovative Teaching and will be honored on October 18th at
  the QC Faculty/Staff Assembly. In 2002, I received the Long Island News 12 Educator of the Month Award. I believe that I am
  qualified to serve on the Standing Committee for Teaching Excellence and Evaluation and am interested in this committee because
  of my committment to good teaching at the college. I am also willing to serve on the Search Committee for the Dean of Graduate
  Studies due to a need that was expressed at the October 12, 2006 Academic Senate meeting. Thank you.</p>
