  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Many people want to make a difference, but few realize they can. This year I have
  made it a priority to bring changes that will benefit the world around me. We're not given much time on this earth, and even
  less time in college, so I have decided to make the most of my brief time by making as positive a difference as I can. My name
  is Daniel Muchnick and I am the student body Vice President. I am also a senator, a delegate to the University Student Senate,
  and Vice President of the Student Friends of the Rosenthal Library Club, an advocacy group working toward improving the
  Rosenthal Library. The Special COmmittee on Technology and Library fits perfectly with my club's goal of enhancing the student
  body experience. I am commited, come prepared, and come on time to meetings. It would be an honor to work with the faculty
  toward arriving at common decisions that benefit all. Thank You.</p>
