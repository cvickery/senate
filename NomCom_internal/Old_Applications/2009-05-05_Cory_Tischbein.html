  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>As an informed and involved Queens College junior, I feel I am qualified to make
  educated, impartial judgments on and contribute to QC elections and their procedures. I have been a writer and editor for the
  campus press, The Knight News, for more than 3 years and will be serving as its editor-in-chief in the '09-'10 academic year.
  I've also been a part of numerous other clubs and organizations on campus, including the Political Science and History clubs,
  and I've taken a variety of challenging courses while maintaining a very competitive GPA, accounting for the great amount of
  knowledge of the college and campus I already possess. I seek to join the Elections Committee because I would like to help
  ensure that QC elections and their procedures are as fair as possible and, as I mentioned above, I believe I am in a position to
  do so. I am interested in joining the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee because I want to help shape the undergraduate
  curriculum for future QC students.</p>
