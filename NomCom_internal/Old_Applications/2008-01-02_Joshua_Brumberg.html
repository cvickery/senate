  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am applying to serve on the search committee to seek a replacement for the Dean
  of the Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. As a member of the Psychology Department faculty I have served on several
  search committees and as a member of the Departmental P&amp;B have be involved in several additional searches. I am actively
  involved in teaching and extramurally funded research here at the College and I think I understand the importance of the
  Divisional Dean in these activities and via interactions with Dean Strekas I feel I have a sense of some of the attributes that
  are necessary for a dean to posses.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Dean of the Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences</p>
