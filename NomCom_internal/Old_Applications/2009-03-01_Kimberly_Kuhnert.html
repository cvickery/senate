  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am a very qualified applicant because of the fact that I've held a huge
  leadership position in the organization called Key Club. In this organization I learned what it was like to be in charge of
  hundreds of high school students that were extremely passionate about community service. I held the position of Leutinent
  Governor. I am running for these specific commities because I believe that being apart of a committee that essentially helps
  elect the officals that represent our school is extremely important. We need to make sure that the people that get elected
  aren't due to biased manners but because they deserve the position.</p>
