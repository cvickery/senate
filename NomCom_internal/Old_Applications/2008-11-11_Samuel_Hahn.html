  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>My name is Samuel Hahn and I am applying to be a member of the search committee
  for the Provost. I am senior with an overall GPA of a 3.889 and 4.0 for my major. I am member of the Golden Key International
  Honor Society, as well as Pi Sigma Alpha Honor Society for Political Science. Currently, I am one of the few members of
  Democratic Student Alliance who are serving as a Student Senators. My personal background is that both of my parents are
  immigrants; my father is German and my mother is Cuban. Therefore, I would bring a unique perspective in finding a Provost who
  cares about diversity and academia.</p>
