  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have been a member of this committe for a number of years, and I have acquired
  a wide knowledge of the variety and needs of programs across the College; in particular, I have become familiar with the very
  different programs in the Division I represent. I have also become familiar with College-wide programs and requirements,
  especially General Education and the way it interacts with the various departments and the variety of student needs. I would
  enjoy the opportunity to continue contributing to the work of the UCC.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Joel -- it was the lack of a phone number that triggered the bug. I added the
  phone number from your page on the web. (And fixed the bug.) Apologies again for the problem. -- Chris</p>
