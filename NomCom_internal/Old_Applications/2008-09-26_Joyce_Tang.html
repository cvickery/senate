  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>26 September 2008 Dear Chair of the Queens College Academic Senate Professor
  Savage, Chair of the Nominating Committee Professor Vickery, and members of the Nominating Committee -- Please accept my
  application for serving on the College's COMMITTEE ON UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS AND RE-ENTRY STANDARDS. As a faculty, I believe
  that my experience in [a] conducting sociological research on women and minorities in the science and engineering fields, [b]
  teaching introductory and advanced level methods courses, and [c] mentoring students would be an asset for the Committee. As an
  advisor, I am familiar with some of the challenges that incoming and returning students have faced because I have helped many
  freshmen and transfer students resolved academic-related issues (e.g., transfer credit evaluations, academic and career
  selections). As a (former and current) member of numerous College and University committees, I have had the opportunities to
  work with many students, staff, and faculty from diverse backgrounds and most importantly benefitted from their collective
  wisdoms. In sum, serving on the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Re-entry Standards would give me an opportunity to
  continue to make contributions to one of the finest undergraduate institutions in the country. Thank you for considering my
  application. Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information from me. Sincerely, JOYCE TANG
  Professor Sociology Department (Powdermaker Hall 252) Queens College of the City University of New York 65-30 Kissena Boulevard
  Flushing, NY 11367 718 997-2839 jtang@qc.edu</p>
