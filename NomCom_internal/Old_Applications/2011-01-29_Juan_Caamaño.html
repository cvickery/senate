<h2>Statement:</h2>
<p>I have been on the USSC for 4 years, and my relationship with the College spans many years, as alum and faculty member. My familiarity with the College allows me to combine both empathy for the circumstances of students as well as commitment to College policies. Likewise, my accumulated experience on USSC will also be valuable in handling prospective student appeals.</p>
