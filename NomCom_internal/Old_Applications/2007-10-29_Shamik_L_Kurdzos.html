  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>My name is Shamik L. Kurdzos, and I am an upper junior/lower senior student here
  at Queens College. I am an individual who loves to learn, grow, be pro-active, and just get involved. During my tenure here at
  the college, I have become a peer counselor, served on the executive board for the Science Organization of Minority Students,
  Emergency Medical Team Appreciation club, and affiliated with other clubs. I went with the college to New Orleans over this past
  spring break to help families; and have just been elected to serve on the Student Union Programming Committee. I am a person
  with passion, sincerity, and - most importantly - integrity. These are some of the primary reason why I believe I could be a
  good candidate for this committee. Thank You for your time!</p>
