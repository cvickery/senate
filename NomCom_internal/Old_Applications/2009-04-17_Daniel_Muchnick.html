  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>My name is Daniel Muchnick and I am now entering my Junior year at Queens
  College. I have pursued a very active path, taking the lead on many initiatives on behalf of the student body. I have been a
  strong advocate for students, as when I lead a coalition effort against Governor Patterson's proposed tuition increase and
  budget cuts for CUNY. I spearheaded the effort to increase the College's weekend library hours, as well the effort to increase
  the amount of free printing credit that students get on their ID cards. I am excellent at balancing my various responsibilities
  and make it a point to show up to all of my meetings on time and participate in the fullest. I am an elected student senator,
  and I wish to serve on Academic Senate committees, so as to make a difference through the influence and creation of legislation.
  Such a duty would truly be an honor on top of all the wonderful opportunities I have been fortunate to receive during my time at
  Queens College. I hope the committee selects me for committee appointments in the preferred order I specified.</p>
