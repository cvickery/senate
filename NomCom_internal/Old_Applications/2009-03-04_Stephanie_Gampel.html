  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Being in the Freshman Honors Program at Queens with a Scholarship, sometimes I
  take it for granted how fortunate I am. I signed up for the "Admissions and Re-entry Standards" standing comittee, because I
  would love to help out those who need some added help in returning to College. That way they too can experience the College life
  everyone deserves. Again, as a Freshman (with the amount of credits to be a Sophmore)I know what it is like to look at a whole
  list of LASARs and other core requirements left to accomplish, and almost feel forced to take certain classes I do not relate
  to. I would like to join the Undergradute Curriculum committee so I can review certain classes, and perhaps work to make the
  curriculum more relatable tp a broader range of students.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I would love to be a part of the Subcommittee of Honarary Degrees to help choose
  my most influential Professors, such as Professor Miceli, and give them the recognition they deserve. Additional, being an
  Honors student I would have the chance to recommend certain of my fellow classmates who have truly taken charge both in class
  presentations and extracurricular activities.</p>
