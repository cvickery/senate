<h2>Statement:</h2>
<p>I have been a member of the Teaching Excellence and Evaluation Committee for the last four years. During that time I was actively involved into process of developing and implementing the new electronic Teaching Evaluation questionnaire. It is my firm believe, that providing faculty with an accurate and representative feedback from students is of utmost importance. I would like to continue my work on developing and improving various tools for the assessment of teaching quality on our campus.</p>
