  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am a former chair of the Department of Family, Nutrition, and Exercise Sciences
  which supports teacher certification programs in Family and Consumer Sciences and Physical Education. I have served on several
  committees during the formative years of Education Unit(an NCATE designation, comprising Departments throughout the College
  supporting training of educational professionals), and presently serve as a member of the Education Unit's Assessment Committee.
  I am familiar with the Division of Education and its mission. As a faculty member from the Division of Math and Natural
  Sciences, I will provide a perspective to the committee's work, which originates from outside the Division of Education.</p>
