  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Currently I'm sitting on the Faculty Student Disciplinary Committee (FSDC) and
  the Charities Committee for Student Association. I have also been an active member in the Committee for Disabled Students. I've
  been a student of Queens College for about two years now and personally I think it's a great school, but there's also always
  room for improvement. I've done a lot of event planning, such as the MDA telethon, fundraisers, canned food drives, Holiday
  parties, and Award dinners. As a student and with these experiences I believe that I can provide some valuable input of my own
  to the Policy Board of Administration Committee. In the Committees I have already been involved in, I have learned leadership
  skills, and even more importantly how to work with others. How to take into account suggestions, opinions, and even complaints,
  and using them to work towards solutions which would better the college and campus life.</p>
