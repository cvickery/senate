  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I think that I would be a excellent addition to Review Committee for the Chief Librarian position. I am a graduate student in
  the MLS program at Queens College and have been an adjunct faculty member at John Jay College for almost ten years. My
  understanding of the concerns and interests of both students and faculty provide me with a unique insight that can greatly help
  the committee. I was an intern in the Rosenthal Library and have a strong grasp of its concerns and workings. As an MLS student
  I have a strong personal interest in the running of the library and wish to help in any way I can. My academic record is
  excellent, having won numerous awards and scholarships from Queens College and was president of the Library and Information
  Studies Student Association for two terms, as well as president of the American Library Association's Student Chapter at Queens.
  Feel free to ask anyone in the MLS department about my qualifications and I will be happy to address any questions.</p>
