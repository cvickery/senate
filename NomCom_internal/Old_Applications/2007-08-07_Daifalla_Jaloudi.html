  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I respectfully ask to be re-considered for the Committee of Undergraduate
  Admissions and Re-Entry Standards and the Special Committee on Governance. I have responsibily served both Committees during the
  Fall 2005 and Spring 2006 semesters. I immensely enjoyed my time on the Committees and have manifested my glee by regularly
  attending meetings, reviewing applicants, and performing my other required tasks. Unfortunately, this year I was required to
  relinquish my position on the Committee of Undergraduate Admissions and Re-Entry Standards. I was chosen under Assmeblyman
  Boyland to intern at the State Assembly in Albany, New York this past Spring. Since my return, I am able to serve on each
  Committe and once more, wish for the oppurtunity to allow the school the benefit of my services.</p>
