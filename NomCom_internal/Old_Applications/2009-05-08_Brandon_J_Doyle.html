  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Since my entry into Queens College, I have already been a member of the United
  States military, specializing in intelligence and communications. I have also received an Associates in Applied Sciences in
  Business Management from Bramson ORT College. And since being on campus even in the first year I have taken the liberty to
  participate in many important events such as the PSC event, regarding the raise in tuition and transportation fare hikes,the
  events regarding the situation in Afghanistan to find a better solution to fixing the nation and its peoples problems, I have
  attended the SA benefit regarding the improved campus quality of life for the disabled. I also participated in SA election
  campaigning, where I originally planned to run for Senate at large but decided running for senate instead of campaigning would
  take far more of my time then I could dedicate to my studies. I currently study Political Science and Government with a
  concentration in International politics. My goals in life are still uncertain but I have main interests in perfecting several
  languages (Spanish and Chinese is one of them I'm currently trying to master, with Arabic, Polish, Russian and Italian being the
  next) and I may take my military training, discipline education and knowledge in cultures and languages to begin a career at the
  Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency. I want one of these committee positions because I want to help
  contribute and leave an enjoyable and lasting impression on incoming students when we create a new and uplifting environment
  every time a student enters the QC campus. We study here, most of us practically live here, and eat and socialize here, that's
  my feelings about the school, and at least if I spend a huge majority of my time on this campus at this university, the least we
  could do is contribute to the greater go od of the school and it's students, and to those would honestly appreciate the extra
  effort we put into it.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>My reasons for wishing to join the Special Committee on Governance is because of
  the knowledge and expertize I gained from being apart of the election process. Unfortunately, even though I believe the voters
  have made their choices, I believe the parties had too much manipulation in the process. American political elections are very
  privatized and should be made that, whether or not I worked alongside UP or DSA. My views are that of my own, and I believe with
  this positions granted to me I could show very that we can create bipartisanship on this campus that creates a true, competitive
  and fair democratic process.</p>
