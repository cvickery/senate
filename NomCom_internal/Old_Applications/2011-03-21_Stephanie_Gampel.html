<h2>Statement:</h2>
<p>21 March 2011 Dear Nominating Committee Chair and Professor Christopher Vickery and Committee Members -- With Miss Stephanie Gampel's consent [CUNY ID# 23007650, Graduation Date: December 2011, Major: Psychology (and Pre-med)], I would like to nominate her to serve on the College's Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Re-entry Standards (CARS) again. During the past two years, I have had the great pleasure of serving with Miss Gampel on this committee. Her service on CARS was outstanding. As members of this important College-wide Committee, Miss Gampel has taken time out of her busy schedule to review hundreds of appeals for re-entry and make recommendations to improve the academic progress of re-admitted students. In short, Miss Gampel has made a positive impact on the life chances of students who are recently re-admitted to Queens. She has indicated to me that she would like to serve on CARS again. Thank you for taking the time to consider the re-nomination of a distinguished member of the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Re-entry Standards like Miss Stephanie Gampel. Please contact me if you have any questions about the nomination or if you need additional information from me. Sincerely, JOYCE TANG Professor of Sociolgy Chair, Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Re-entry Standards Powdermaker 252Q jtang@qc.edu 718.997.2839</p>
