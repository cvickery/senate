1.  The web page is standards-compliant ... mostly.  There is a
Mozilla-specific extension in the style-all.css file to put the
rounded corners on the border of the content box:
  -moz-border-radius: 10pt;
When CSS3 is finalized and implemented by browsers, change the
the line to:
  border-radius: 10pt;
or whatever syntax it takes in the final version of CSS3.
Meantime, it seems to do no harm, and looks nice in Firefox.

2.  There are two index pages in the Minutes directory, index.html,
and index.php.  When/if OCT lets us use embedded php without going
through cgi-wrap, the index.html page can be removed so the php file
gets used.  For now index.html does a redirect to the corresponding
directory on babbage.cs.qc.edu.

  The PHP script in the Minutes directory generates the list of links
  to meeting minutes by scanning the directory for files with names in
  the form yyyy-mm-dd.pdf. All ten characters must appear in the date
  part of the file name, and must all be numeric except for the
  hyphens.
  
  Just upload new pdf files to this directory, make sure they have
  read access permissions set for everyone, and they will immediately
  and automatically be added to the list.
