  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Serving as an undergraduate advisor for students in the EECE department, I have
  the opportunity to meet and work with a very diverse population of students. This past spring I volunteered to serve on our
  department's Awards and Honors Committee. I found this experience very rewarding because it provided me the chance to celebrate
  the many achievements of the students in our program. I would like to serve on the college-wide Awards and Honors Committee so I
  can learn more about the achievements of undergraduates who excel in other disciplines. As a relatively new faculty member
  (beginning second year), I also feel that serving on this committee would provide me with the opportunity to meet and work with
  college faculty from other departments and divisions.</p>
