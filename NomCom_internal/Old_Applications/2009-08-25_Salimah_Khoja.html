  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Having a strong leadership history, I have the qualifications to be the best
  candidate for the Elections Committee. I served as Chief Editor of my high school medical journal taking a hefty load on myself
  holding regular meetings, recruiting more members, editing countless article submissions, and making sure all tasks were
  completed in a timely fashion. I learned how to balance the academic workload with the extracurricular which is one of the
  skills necessary for an extracurricular activity. To add to my leadership resume, I served as President of the Student Council
  at my religious school. As president I was an ardent communicator for the betterment of student life at my religious school. I
  and more importantly my team became the voice of the student body, improving the studentsâ€™ overall religious education
  experience. Furthermore, the religious school management felt that I did a phenomenal job as President and promoted me to
  Coordinator of Student Council to make a better team of officers and members. As coordinator I serve as a liaison between the
  student council and management to voice student opinion. The elections committee needs representatives that have strong pride
  for the college, excellent leadership skills, and the ability to make integral decisions that will affect the entire election
  process of our student government. I am not only committed but also am aware of the issues. Therefore I will be able to make
  informed decisions during committee meetings,which in turn ensures my regular attendance in these meetings. It is important to
  make sure that these key positions be bestowed upon those who are responsible, loyal, and show a strong sense of commitment
  because without this foundation the building will never stand. Our goal is not to make just a building, but to construct a
  skyscraper for the betterment of our Queens College Community.</p>
