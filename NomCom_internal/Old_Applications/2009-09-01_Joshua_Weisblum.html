  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Hi my name is Joshua Weisblum I am a new student here at Queens College. I am
  dedicated to serving the College community and I really want to get involved and make a difference on campus for myself and
  fellow students. I have done some research on the Queens College website looking for ways to develop my leadership and I believe
  by serving on this Academic Senate committee will be beneficial for myself and my peers. I was very involved in my high school
  with student council. I enjoy following politics and the legislative process. I am very familiar with elections and I want to
  serve in the capacity as Elections Committee member. I am responsible, punctual and I always make sure to follow up with my
  responsibilities and I feel like those qualities would make me perfect for this particular committee. I thank you for your
  consideration and look forward to serving.</p>
