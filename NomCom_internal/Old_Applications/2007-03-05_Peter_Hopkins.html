  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am a Sociology major, and I am considering Higher Education Administration as
  my career goal. Participating in a standing committee would be an ideal credential toward my goal, and would serve as relevant
  experience. Throughout my college experience I was obligated to work part-time in order to pay my tuiition, car insurance, and
  for my books; hence it was extremely difficult to engage in extra curricular activities. This semester I have more free time,
  and would like to spend that time wisely. I feel I would be an ideal candidate for an Academic Senate Committee.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am applying for the Admissions and Re-entry Committee. I have taken courses
  which are relevant to this field such as Social Research, and Indutrial Organization Psychology.</p>
