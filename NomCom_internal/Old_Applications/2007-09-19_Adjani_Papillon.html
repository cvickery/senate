  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Since my freshman year at Queens College, I have been dedicated to serving the
  student body and helping students achieve their goals. I have been very active as a Peer Counselor. I receive training from
  administrators, Faculty, staff Psychologist and Counselors to handle any questions or concerns that students may have about
  academics. This experience also affords me the chance to build lasting relationships with students and understand their concerns
  about our curriculum. I am also the Academics Chairperson of Student Association. This position has enabled me to serve as a
  liaison between the students and the faculty and administrators. Along the way, I have developed determination and optimism that
  are so much part of my character. My great work ethics and leadership skills make me an excellent candidate for this position. I
  know that if elected I will bring positive contributions to the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee.</p>
