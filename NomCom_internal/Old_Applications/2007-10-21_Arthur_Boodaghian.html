  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have been teaching at Queens College on and off for the last thirty years. I
  was the Director of The Weekend College as well as an administrator during the years when the College was trying to push forward
  the Graduate Journalism program. I have been associated with the College since 1969 as an admiistrator as well as a teacher and
  am totally familiar with all aspects of the College. Scholastic standards and the Undergraduate Curriculum are areas that I
  strongly feel should be given very high priority. My years in the business industry will also be of great value to the College
  commumity--especially our student body.</p>
