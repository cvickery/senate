  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have served on the committee during the development of the new General
  Education requirements and I have been actively involved in this task. Now that we have have reached the implementation stage
  for the new PLAS requirements, I look forward to continuing that work as we see new or revised course through the process of
  entering the curriculum. I think it is particularly important that we keep our focus on the goals of undergraduate liberal arts
  as a comprehensive preparation for a thoughtful and productive life, and that we base our decisions on the best reflections of
  the students and faculty. So I remain especially interested in how general education is integrated into the other aspects of
  undergraduate education, and also, as representative of the Arts Division, in the role of the programs in the Arts and
  Humanities both as a group of majors and as contributors to the intellectual life of the College.</p>
