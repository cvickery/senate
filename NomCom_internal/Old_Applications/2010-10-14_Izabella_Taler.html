  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>Please accept this application for the Review Committee for Chief Librarian. I have been a faculty member of the Library
  Department for over 30 years during which time I have held various administrative posts. I have served numerous times in the
  past and I am currently serving on the Library's P&amp;B committee chaired by Dr. Shaddy. In addition to being a very active
  member of the department, I have and continue to demonstrate a strong service commitment to this College. In the past I have
  served on the IRB , numerous Academic Senate Committees and presently I serve on the Senate's Executive Committee. I believe
  that my extensive experience at the College and the Library Department will benefit the Review Committee.</p>
