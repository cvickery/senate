  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Admission standards and undergraduate scholastic standards increases are the key
  elements that will achieve higher standing in the academic world for Queens College. This will attract higher students and more
  prestigious professors and research. In turn we, Queens College, will be able to get more grant money and further our
  reputation. Campus affairs are also important to attract students to the school and aid in their enjoying and appreciating
  college. At the same time we must keep in mind that we are a community school and have a responsibility to the Queens community.
  I am an economics major with a minor in chemistry and am in the honors in mathematics and natural sciences program. In my Queens
  College endeavors I have a 3.98 GPA. My studies in economics have given me the skills to do cost benefit analyses, which are
  essential to any position of leadership. I have the ability to analyze areas in which updates are necessary to better the
  school. I am dedicated to my undertakings and am punctual to meetings.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am enrolled in an Honors program, Honors in Mathematics and Natural Sciences,
  and can sense who is deserving of recognition and praise. I also know how to deal with people and can aid in governing the
  school.</p>
