  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I would like to be considered for membership on the search committee for the Dean
  of Education. I was involved in the selection process of the Dean of Education at another institution, while a graduate student.
  I will bring the prospective of a junior faculty member to the search committee. I believe that the new dean should be capable
  of not only supporting scholarship and teaching, but creating an environment were faculty members can develop productive
  partnerships among fellow Division of Education faculty members. I am aware of the importance of our upcoming NCATE review,
  which the Dean will have to be able to provide leadership too immediately. In addition, the dean should be committed to
  advancing our Division’s three Core Values: Equity, Excellence and Ethics. Thank you for your consideration!</p>
