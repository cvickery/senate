  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am applying to be part of the Dean of Mathematics and Natural Sciences Search
  (DMNS) Committee. I have been part of three faculty search committees and as a member of the Psychology Department’s Personnel
  and Budget Committee I have participated in another five searches over the past five years and thus have a good sense of the
  procedures involved with searches. I am the head of the largest PhD program based on the Queens College campus (Neuropsychology
  ~72 PhD students) and as a result have worked with the D MNS over the past 5 years on issues related to PhD programs in the
  sciences. With the reorganization of the science PhD programs my experiences here at QC and at the Graduate Center have made me
  aware of many issues that a new Dean will have to face and thus puts me in a good position to be able to evaluate the
  candidates. At present I have two extramural awards (NIH and NSF) and serve on a NIH study section (F02B) and with the College’s
  increased emphasis on extramural funding I am versed in many of the issues that the new Dean will be involved in regarding
  increasing extramural funding within the Division. I have interacted with the DMNS as part of the divisional committee that
  successfully received a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Award and in managing two RESO-A renovation projects in Razran and thus
  have a sense of some of the issues that the holder of the position will face. As a relatively young professor I will hopefully
  be in a position to interact with the Dean on a long term basis and thus I have a keen interest in being involved in the
  selection process.</p>
