  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Academic Senator 2002-2003, President Student Association 2006-2007, Academic
  Senator 2006-2007. There are many diverse reasons on why students choose not only to become an academic senator but choose to
  sit on an academic senate committee. I am interested in serving on the Graduate Curriculum committee because changes in
  curriculum are very important, whether it's at an undergraduate or graduate level. I have attended as a guest to many UCC
  meetings as an undergrad here at queens college and found the meetings to be very important. As the current student body
  President of Queens College and a 1st year Graduate student I know I can bring a wide variety of ideas to GCC and will be
  committed to improving our Graduate curriculum studies here at Queens College.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I would like to be on the Search and Review for Committee for the Dean of
  Graduate Studies. I currently sit on the Search for the Vice-President of Student Affairs and realize how important ALL searches
  are. Being a Graduate student, I know I can bring a lot to the search for the Dean of Graduate Studies.</p>
