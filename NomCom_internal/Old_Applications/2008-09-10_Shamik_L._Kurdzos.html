  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>While embarking on a unique journey, such as my college endeavors; I have
  excelled in the classroom and engaged in many extracurricular activities. I have joined Peer Counseling, Student Government, and
  a Black Men's Focus Group. Additionally, I have served on the executive board for S.O.M.S - Science Organization for Minority
  Students, and have been actively involved with other clubs on campus. I've been featured on the Queens College website, as well
  as the new Peer Counseling poster displayed outside of Frese Hall. Moreover, I have served on the S.U.P.C. - Student Union
  Programming Committee, and have become a Student Orientation Leader. Lastly, I would like to serve on the elections committee
  because I would like to gain more of an in depth knowledge of the entire elections process. Also, I am a SEEK student and I
  think it would be of interest to have a non-traditional representative on the committee.</p>
