  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am a sophomore at queens college who has taken an interest into campus
  politics.I have tried to fully integrate myself into campus life as well as keep to a high academic standard. I have been
  involved with several clubs as well as conduct research in physics. I feel that it is important for students to take an active
  role in the running of the college. The Undergraduate Scholastic Standards Committee is a committee that has a large affect on
  students, especially ones that have special needs. I hope to help serve the college and the students by becoming a member the
  committee. I will take my responsibilities to the committee seriously and make the up most effort to attend all the
  meetings.</p>
