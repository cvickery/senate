  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have been a student leader for many years, after being student government
  President in South Shore High school I became the President of the alumni foundation and continue to serve as its president
  currently. I have been the vice President of the Republican coalition on campus and currently serve as the Vice Chair of the
  Political Affairs Committee. I am also a Senator of the academic senate for the upper Junior and senior contingent. I have had
  the unique opportunity to also have been a volunteer Asst Professor in Touro College where I was a scholar of Talmudic
  literature. The opportunity to serve on an Academic Senate Committee would be for me a particularly appropriate position, being
  that I have had the experience of being an active student and a professorâ€™s aid. The Idea of being on a Committee of both
  teachers and students truly interests me and with my experience I believe I would be a strong candidate for any committee. I
  have chosen the elections committee because as a political science major and a candidate in many elections I find interest in
  the entire political and democratic process. I have actively participated in elections since High school and I know there inner
  working and varying circumstances. As a student of political science I also believe this would enhance my education of politics
  and that I would gain from the faculty that I would be associated with in a very beneficial way.</p>
