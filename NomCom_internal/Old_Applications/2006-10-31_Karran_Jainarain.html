  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I had applied to be on this committee before but was not nominated because I am
  graduating in the Fall of 2006. However, I will be applying to the graduate program in Elementary Education at Queens College. I
  would still like to be considered for the International Student Affairs Committee as a graduate student. I am aware of the
  issues faced by international students because I am an international student myself. As the President of the International
  Student Club, I am very active on campus and have participated in many of the activities sponsored by the Club and the
  International Student Office. I would welcome an opportunity to serve on this committee to further the causes of international
  students at Queens College.</p>
