  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have served on both the Writing Intensive Subcommittee and the Writing Across
  the Curriculum Committe. I was on the Media Studies department's Undergraduate Studies Committee for 6 years, and I chaired the
  Committee five of those years. I would like to broaden my understanding of curricular issues beyond the purview of my own
  department, and I hope that my experience in curriculum committee work would be of value to you. I am also a member of the
  Theatre faculty at the Graduate Center, so I do have some background in graduate curricular issues.</p>
