  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>This will be my second term as Chair of the Committee on Honors and Awards. The experience that I have gained in chairing the
  committee will help me to keep the committee running smoothly and to make sure that the award winner are selected in a fair and
  unbiased manner. Since I have become chair of the committee and we have switched to on-line submissions of student applications
  and faculty letters of recommendation, more students than ever who are eligible have been considered for college-wide
  awards.</p>
