  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I would like to serve on the Elections Committee, for two reasons. One, as a student who has never run for office in the
  past, I have no preference in either political party (DSA, UP). I believe that the only way to improve elections at QC is
  through a balanced/nonpartisan committee, which will seek to enforce the electoral rules without disadvantaging either political
  party. Two, I have recently become more involved in school activities, and as a result have learned the impact that students can
  have on campus; consequently, I wish to make a positive impact in the Spring elections by helping to conduct civilized and
  responsible elections on campus (differently from elections conducted in the past). Although I have submitted my application
  past the deadline, I hope the committee will consider my application, as I would truly love the opportunity to serve on such an
  important committee for this campus.</p>
