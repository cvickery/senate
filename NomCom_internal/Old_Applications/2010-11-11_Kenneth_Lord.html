  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I have been serving as chair of the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee for many years and find it rewarding, challenging
  work. The curriculum is the heart of the college, and helping it to grow and change is vital to the life of the college. It is
  particularly interesting to be working on the general education requirements as they prosper under the auspices of the new Dean
  of General Education and the General Education Advisory Committee. I believe that I have been doing satisfactory work on the UCC
  (unfortunate occasional tantrums at the Senate notwithstanding) and would like very much to continue.</p>
