  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I believe that I can contribute to the the environment within the Academic
  Senate. I closely follow politics, being that I am aiming to be a Political Science major follow the American Law and Politics
  track. The Academic Senate gives me a chance to work within a political system that will help me put my studies of politics and
  choice to practice. I also feel that I can help other students with advice and general support, in order to voice their concerns
  with a position in the Academic Senate. I think that the standards for students are important and need to be observed so that
  they can excel within their particular field. I also want to work on the committee on Governance in order to ensure that the
  Senate is on a great track to serve the students and faculty of Queens College.</p>
