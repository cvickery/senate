  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>As an assistant professor at Queens College, I strive to promote equity and
  diversity for all learners in such a way that they could reach their academic and professional goals within an educational
  environment full of pedagogical content knowledge and skills. Through my teaching to my students and serving my Queens College
  community, one of my goals is to promote professional disposition necessary to help all my students and members in our
  community. Two important themes that guide my teaching and service at Queens College are: to be a caring educator to help my
  students to reach their highest potential and to enhance my students’ self-efficacy beliefs in such a way that they could
  acquire the beliefs and capability to secure high academic achievement. With regard to diversity, I believe on celebrating
  equity in my classrooms to provide reaching experiences to all my students. While I was an undergraduate student at t he
  University of Michigan majoring in Psychology, I was a member of the Psi Chi honor society for my academic performance even
  though I was improving my English proficiency. While pursuing my master’s degree, I was the first student in completing my
  degree in my cohort and while completing my Ph.D. I was the second student in completing my program. From these experiences, I
  learned to understand students’ achievement and academic merits beyond the traditional high grade point average such as special
  service and unique contribution to the Queens College community. I admire students who could celebrate learning and academic
  achievement through their effort, dedication, motivation, and self-regulation of learning. I strongly believe that my personal
  and professional experience I qualify to serve in the Honors and Award Committee.</p>
