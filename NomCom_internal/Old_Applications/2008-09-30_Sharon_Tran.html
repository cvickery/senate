  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I believe I am qualified to serve on the Academic Senate student-faculty review
  committee because I am a double major in English and East Asian Studies with a strong humanities background and good academic
  standing in both departments. As a Macaulay Honors student, Queens College Ambassador, and Mellon Mays Scholar I also have broad
  college experiences that will enable me to provide the committee with a unique student perspective. In the future I hope to
  attain a PhD in literature with a focus on Vietnamese poetry and prose. As someone who plans to pursue a career in academia I
  would really appreciate an opportunity to learn more about colleges in terms of administrative proceedings and the role of deans
  on campus. I am particularly interested in serving on the review committee for Dean Tamara Evans because I believe it is
  important for students to take an active role in evaluating the administrators who will ultimately influence their
  education.</p>
