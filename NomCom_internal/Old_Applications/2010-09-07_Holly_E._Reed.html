  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>This is my third year of teaching for our MA in Applied Social Research program in the Sociology department at Queens. It is
  also my second semester teaching for the PhD program in Sociology at the Graduate Center, so I have good understanding of the
  graduate students and the curriculum in the social sciences at CUNY. Prior to obtaining my PhD, I worked as a program officer at
  the National Academy of Sciences, where I worked with many academic researchers and professors from around the country in a
  variety of different settings. I would be pleased to help the committee to further graduate educational opportunities at
  Queens.</p>
