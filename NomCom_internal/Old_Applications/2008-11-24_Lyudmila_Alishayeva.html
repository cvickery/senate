    <h2>Statement:</h2>
    <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am currently completing my one year term on the Undergraduate Scholastic
    Standards Committee. Through my service on this committee, I feel that I have become acquainted with a variety of issues and
    procedures by which these issues are handled. I am far better qualified than I was a year ago and feel that I will be an asset
    to any committee due to my eagerness to learn and contribute. Additionally, I am currently taking a class as part of my Business
    and Liberal Arts (BALA) Minor called Law and Ethics, which I believe has exposed me to a better understanding of the law.
    Another class I have taken as part of BALA in the past, entitled Critical Thinking in Business, has helped me to do just
    that--think critically--an asset to any committee.</p>
