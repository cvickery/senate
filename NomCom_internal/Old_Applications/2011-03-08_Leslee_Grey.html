<h2>Statement:</h2>
<p>8 March 2010 Dear Chair/Professor Vickery and Members of the Nominating Committee: With the consent and permission of Dr. Leslee Grey (Secondary Education and Youth Services) and the recommendation of Dean Francine Peterman on February 22, 2011, I would like to nominate Dr. Leslee Grey to fill the Education Division faculty seat of the Undergraduate Committee on Admissions and Re-entry Standards (CARS). The faculty seat for the Education Division has been vacant for several years. To serve our students effectively, it is best to have the input of faculty from all divisions when making policy recommendations to the Senate. It is my anticipation that Dr. Grey's service on CARS will have a very positive impact on the quality of learning and academic progress of re-admitted students at Queens. Please contact me if you have any questions or if you need additional information from me. Thank you for considering the nomination of Dr. Grey. JOYCE TANG PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY MEMBER OF THE UNDERGRADUATE COMMITTEE ON ADMISSIONS AND RE-ENTRY STANDARDSÂ <a href="mailto:jtang@qc.edu" target="_blank">jtang@qc.edu</a></p>
