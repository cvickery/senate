  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>16 October 2006 TO: Professor Dean Savage, Chair of Queens College's Academic
  Senate FR: Joyce Tang, Sociology, Queens College RE: Committee for the Search of the Dean of Research and Graduate Studies I am
  interested in serving on the Search Committee for the DEAN OF RESEARCH AND GRADUATE STUDIES. In addition to being a College-wide
  Senator on the College's Academic Senate, I have served on various University- and College-wide committees, such as the CUNY
  Advisory Committee on the CPE Exam (2001-present), QC's Committee on Health Professions (2000-present), and QC's Asian American
  Center Advisory Board (2001-present). Last Spring I was on QC's Middle States Affirmative Action Task Force and currently I am
  on QC's Strategic Planning Committee on Strengthening the Quality of the College Experience for All Students. I believe that my
  experience in working with colleagues at Queens and across CUNY would make a contribution to our search for the Dean of Research
  and Graduate Studies. Assitionally, as one of the finest academic institutions in the nation, it is essential for Queens College
  to look for a leader in teaching and research but also someone who is committed to advance research and graduate education.
  Thank you for considering my application. Please do not hesitate to contact me at 718 997-2839 if you have any questions or if
  you need additional information from me.</p>
