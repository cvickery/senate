  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>As a transfer student with a 4.0 GPA from Binghamton University, I have bore
  witness to the various General Education requirements currently being employed on other college campuses, and as Queens College
  is making the transition from LASARs to General Education courses, I feel as though my knowledge and experiences away from the
  QC campus will be an asset to the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee. This past January, during Winter break, I was an invited
  guest to the UCC meeting, run by Dr. Kenneth Lord, and various suggestions that I brought to the table were touted by both the
  student representatives as well as the faculty members present. Moreover, I was informed that the At Large seat of the UCC was
  being vacated, and I would very much like to take on the responsibility for this individual. Coming from a family of educators
  and administrators, and being a Secondary Education minor myself, I have a fervent interest in the review of syllabi from a wide
  range of content areas, and I sincerely believe that my pedagogical instinct will greatly benefit the Undergraduate Curriculum
  Committee during this crucial time in the college's history. Thank you so very much for your consideration.</p>
