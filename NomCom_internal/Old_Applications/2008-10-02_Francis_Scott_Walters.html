  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>My qualifications related to instructional technology include having taught
  courses in computer literacy for English as a second language (ESL) students; conducted research into acquisition of ESL writing
  ability via computer-based tutorials; incorporated various types of software (e.g., Excel) and hardware (laptops, projectors)
  into my teacher-training courses. My qualifications related to library science come from several years of post-graduate research
  employing hardcopy and electronic library facilities. My interest in serving on the Special Committee on Technology and Library
  lies in working with others to find new ways to apply IT and library resources for students and faculty, both for pedagogical
  purposes and for research.</p>
