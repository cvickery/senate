  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>With about 10 years of being the designated adviser to evaluate foreign credits,
  I would like to see some policy change on everything from the system of evaluation foreign credits to improving their English
  and getting an "permanent" advisor in the area of their interest as soon as possible after their arrival on compus. This is
  especially important because the Economics Deparment gets many students who are interested i Economics, the BBA and related
  area. I also think that we should try to develop honors sections and discussion sessions for those foreign students who want to
  develop their English language skills, problem solving, and knowledge of USA and world cultures (through reading and seminars)
  as well as American and world cultures. I have already experimented with voluntary sections meeting weekly to decuss a selected
  article in the WSJ and want me to continue you it this semester. Is there any financal support an! d other recognition. They
  loved it. Michael R. Dohan, Associate Prof. of Economics</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I would like to review and publicize the expected behavior of students in the
  classroom, increase the penalty for cheating, provision of extra proctors for exams, the study requirements and also harassment
  of professors by students. Once in 37 year - but still. Also, we need to develop a system to identify students with mental
  illness and get them help. I have one this semester.</p>
