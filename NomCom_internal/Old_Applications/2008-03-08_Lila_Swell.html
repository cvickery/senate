  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am the deputy chair of Early Childhood and Elementary Education (EECE)
  department and, in that capacity, I have worked with the Dean of the Division of Education in the following areas: 1.
  Preparation of NCATE materials and site visit events 2. Kappa Delta Pi, international honor society in Education 3. Alumni
  Funding Council committee for the Division of Education 4. Day-to-day operations of the EECE department I have been at Queens
  College since 1970, and during that time I have had the opportunity to work under many deans. Because of this, I am able to
  assess our current dean's performance in relationship to other deans of Education. In addition, because I have served on other
  review committees, i.e., for former dean of students, I believe I am qualified to serve on the Dean's Review Committee. For all
  these reasons, I am asking to be nominated to serve on this very important committee.</p>
