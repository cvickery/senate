  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am very interested in becoming a member of the Academic Senate primarily
  because I have a strong interest in actively participating in decision-making processes that affect my educational environment.
  In high school, I was involved with my Student Council beginning freshman year as a Student Representative, culminating in the
  attainment of the Presidency in my senior year. During those 4 years of participation in the Student Council, I worked closely
  and effectively with my peers, faculty and administration with the intent of improving the school in all aspects of student
  life, from planning student activities to mediating disputes between the student body and school disciplinary protocols. I hope
  to utilize the skills I acquired during my high school years by putting them to work for the Queens College Academic Senate. I
  strongly believe that a close, working relationship between the faculty, students and administration leads to a better college
  experience overall.</p>
