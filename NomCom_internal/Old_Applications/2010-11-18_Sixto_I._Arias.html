  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I am a very involved student who likes to take part of activities around campus. I am also involved in Student Association
  and hold an executive position of executive assistant. The campus affairs and environment committee appeals to me because it
  allows me to voice my opinion about issues that students want to see brought to attention and resolved. Due to the tornado that
  hit Queens College on mid September, there is also a lot of renovations that need to be brought to our campus to bring it back
  to it's original state of beauty.</p>
