  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have been at Queens College since Fall 2008. As a transfer student, I realized
  that there's so much that our school need to work on in enhancing the quality of our education. I have been involved in many
  student organizations on campus in addressing the upcoming curriculum for the class of 2013. I have also attended Academic
  Senate meetings and observe how the body reacts to the new curriculum requirement. I believe that I can put my energy into this
  body. I am not afraid of new challenges. I am ready to work for Queens College. Currently, I am also member of NYPIRG. I have
  worked on many projects that addressing students' needs and concerns such as lobbying against tuition hikes, participating in
  letter drives against the MTA fare hikes. Yesterday 5/5/09, I participated Earth Day lobbying day in Albany. I met with state
  officials to support the Bigger Better Bottle Bill which will help make our campus cleaner and bring back more revenue to the
  state of New York. Therefore, these tasks have prepared me to understand the meaning of hard work and dedication. I will be able
  to apply all that I learn to this committee.</p>
