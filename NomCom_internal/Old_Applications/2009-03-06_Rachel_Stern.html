  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am and always have been interested in making my school a better place. In High
  School I was Vice President, petitioning for Drivers Ed courses and fair testing policies. I choose the committees based on my
  strengths and interests. My first choice is the Undergraduate Scholastic Standards as I want to see and help with the issues and
  policies that this committee deals with (like grading and grading policies) My Second choice is the Undergraduate Curriculum
  committee. I am also interested in helping to form curriculum and the like. My Third choice is the Campus Affairs Committee. I
  am interested in helping Queens College with its Student affairs as well as interactions with the outside world.</p>
