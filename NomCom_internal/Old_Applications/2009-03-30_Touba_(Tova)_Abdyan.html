  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have never taken part in any school government before, therefore I am unaware
  of the qualifications for a committee position. I can however say that I am a leader, which is a position in and of itself. I
  work as a dental assistant/receptionist, which has taught be how to make decisions and keep up with the high speed work life. I
  will be trilled to receive an acceptance to any of the three committees I selected. Upon joining the Admissions and Re-entry
  Standards committee or Undergraduate Scholastic Standards, I will strive to make the best choices regarding the topic at hand
  with careful consideration for each. I will offer an informed opinion for any problem that rises. I will push for college
  policies that will set a high academic standard for the college. Any student that does not achieve the standard level will need
  to receive assistance to excel beyond their borders. This will come into play when proper grading policies are reinforced; this
  would entail the committee promoting fair grading policies to the professors, and not encourages curves that land the majority
  of students at the top of their class based on inflated grades. I will also attentively listen to the concerns of the students
  regarding academic matters. Acheiveing these goals will improve the reputation of the college, academics, and student life.</p>
