  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I have always thought that it was important for me to feel like I had a say in the institution I attended. In high school I
  really tried to make to make a difference and to really be active. I was part of Model UN, the executive council of Arista, and
  took part in a leadership class for 3 years. I was also elected to be senior council vice president of my class. Being a
  freshman I would love to take control of the undergraduate curriculum. I feel like I have fresh eyes and that I really know what
  incoming students want to see and learn in Queens College. As my second choice campus affairs and environment can be cool
  because it I think it is important to keep strong interaction with the community. It is also exciting to be able to honor past
  Queens College members. I picked International Student Affairs as my third choice because I have always had a dream to travel
  around the world and study in another country and if someones dream is to study here I want to make sure that they can achieve
  it no matter what their academic interest is.</p>
