  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am currently an alternate Senator in the Academic Senate, aligned with the
  Democratic Student Alliance. After witnessing the state of the elections in the past years, I would like to be able to
  participate in actively making them better and fairer. I am well acquainted with the current election system at Queens College,
  and I feel that I would have much to contribute to the Elections Committee. Additionally, I feel it would be in the best
  interest of the Senate to have bipartisan representation on the Elections Committee. Currently only one party has membership on
  this important committee, and this is clearly not an ideal situation. I therefore submit my application for the Elections
  Committee. Aaron Friedman Democratic Student Alliance</p>
