  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I am currently a graduate student in the School Psychology program (3.9 GPA) where I am a co-editor of the program's
  newsletter. Additionally, I am a former member of the Undergraduate Scholastic Standards&#160;Committee&#160;at Queens College.
  As a&#160;committee&#160;member, I appreciated the opportunity to participate in the review process of&#160;academic&#160;policy
  and acting on student appeals. This experience was positive and fulfilling, and I hope to have the opportunity to participate in
  the Graduate Scholastic Standards&#160;Committee&#160;in a similar capacity. Alternatively, I believe that the Graduate
  CurriculumCommittee&#160;would provide me with an entirely new experience. I hope this experience will be as challenging and
  rewarding as my previous experience as a&#160;committee&#160;member.</p>
