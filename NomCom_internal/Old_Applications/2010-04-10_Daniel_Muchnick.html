  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have served as an Academic Senator for two years, as well as in the capacity of
  Student Association Vice President and President. Through my tenure, I've recruited dozens of students to join various
  organizations and committees. I fully understand the importance of Academic Senate committees and the commitment that is
  required of students selected for them, and I can communicate this to interested students to ensure that they understand it too.
  I also have an established rapport with the current student members of the Nominating committee. I feel I can be an asset to
  this committee in giving my opinions on nominees as well as recruiting for the committee, should that service be needed of
  me.</p>
