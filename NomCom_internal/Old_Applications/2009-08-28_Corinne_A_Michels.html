  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am Chair of Biology (since January 2001) and a CUNY Distinguished Professor
  will a respected career as a research scientist. The Academic Year 2009/2010 marks my 38th year on the faculty of Queens
  College. Because of my experience and expertise, I feel I have an excellent perspective on the kinds characteristics that are
  important in an individual capable of carrying out and succeeding in the various roles played by the Dean of Mathematics &amp;
  Natural Sciences. This is a complex position that relates to the academic advancement of the Division on the undergraduate and
  graduate levels, faculty hiring and development, facilities maintenance and construction, support of the CUNY doctoral programs
  in the sciences, and interfacing with the College and CUNY administration, to name a few. It is necessary to find someone with
  strong leadership qualities, a vision for the sciences and science education, and excellent interpersonal ski lls. I served on
  the previous Dean Search Committee in 2008 but the candidates put forward were not approved. I would like the opportunity to
  serve again.</p>
