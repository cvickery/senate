  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Hi, my name is Ellis Cortez and I would like to serve on the elections committee.
  I have served on academic senate for two years now, once as an alternate senator and currently as a junior/senior senator. This
  past summer I worked as a deputy campaign manager for a City Council member. I have been involved on campus since my freshman
  year. I was a student ambassador and member of many clubs. I am also currently president of Future Healers of America. I have
  also been involved with Student Association for three years now. I am hardworker and a very fair person. When a discussion is
  raised I always try to view different points. I feel like I would be a great candidate to serve on the elections committee.
  Thank you so much for your time.</p>
