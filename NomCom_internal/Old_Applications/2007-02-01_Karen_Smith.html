  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have served several terms on the Graduate Scholastics Standing Committee and
  enjoy having the opportunity to serve in this capacity. I have been a faculty member in the Graduate School of Library and
  Information Studies since 1987. I previously served as Graduate Advisor for the Department from 1991-2001. For the past several
  years I have also served as Summer Session Supervisor. In this capacity, I am responsible for admitting students into the
  program and for addressing issues of student affairs during the summer session. Therefore, I feel that I am qualified to
  continue serving as a member of GSSC. Thank you.</p>
