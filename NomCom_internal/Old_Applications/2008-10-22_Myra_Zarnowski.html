  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am willing to serve on the Search Committee for the Dean of Education. As a
  former chairperson, P &amp; B member, and long time faculty member, I believe it is important that the person selected to be
  Dean can work well with our current faculty on issues of urban education and cutting edge research. We also nearing our next
  NCATE review and it would be important that the new dean be ready to assume this responsibility. Most of all, the new Dean
  should be enthusiastic about scholarship and teaching.</p>

  see paragraph above.</p>
