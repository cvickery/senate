  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>As former president of the Student Government Association (SGA) at Queensborough Community College, I had the opportunity to
  shape the electoral process at the college, which today is still in place. Now at Queens College, in an effort to change what I
  see are flaws in the system, I would like to use my knowledge to give useful and effective input into the process in the hopes
  of bettering the system. Also, as a former student leader, I had the opportunity to sit on numerous committees with faculty and
  administrators, which have taught me the importance of attending meetings and communicating effectively with faculty and
  administrators. If elected to the committee, I would take responsibility for attending every meeting, and most importantly
  communicating effectively with administrators and faculty so that elections could be as smooth as experience has taught me they
  could be.</p>
