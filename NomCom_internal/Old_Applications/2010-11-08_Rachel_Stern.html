  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I am a highly involved student at Queens College. I have dedicated myself to improving my community through service and
  dedication. As the Co-Chair of the Student Election Committee (dedicated to raising awareness about the elections). I sought to
  increase campus participation and interest in the elections. My duties as an RA or Resident Assistant at the Summit have also
  given me unique experiences that I hope to use to benefit the Queens College community at large. My duties on the Undergraduate
  Scholastic Standards committee has helped me gain experience as a member of a Queens College committee and I hope to be able to
  continue to do as such.</p>
