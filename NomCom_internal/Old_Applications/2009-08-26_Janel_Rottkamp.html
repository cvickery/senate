  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>My name is Janel Rottkamp, and I am an incoming freshman for the Fall 2009
  semester. Over the years, I have found myself to have had a growing interest in government, politics and political action. As I
  find myself becoming more serious about eventually pursuing these fields as a career path, I have grown to want to explore
  different dimensions of them. For my entire high school career, I was very involved in the schoolâ€™s Model Congress organization.
  While in this organization, I was largely responsible for being a leader and an innovator. The club itself focused itself around
  the development of opinions and expressing those views in the form of organized debate, and at the close of that debate, those
  presiding in the committee would vote on the issue either in favor of the primary sponsor of it, or the opposition, one of which
  I often was. As an active participant in Model Congress for my high school, I was an influential leader and received awards for
  my ideas and for my ability to successfully draw others into our debates. My expanding interest in political science, however,
  leaves me in a position where I want to explore different aspects of politics. I feel like being a member of the Elections
  Committee would provide me with the opportunity to satisfy my interest. Although my participation in the Elections Committee is
  not entirely comparable to my activity in Model Congress, I feel my involvement in Model Congress would enable me to bring a
  unique perspective to this committee. I am an opinionated individual, and when appropriate, I vocalize those opinions. I have a
  genuine interest in furthering my involvement in the Student Association and in political involvement, both on and off campus. I
  am organized, committed, punctual, and capable of following existing election procedures, as well as providing feedback on ways
  to potentially improve those procedures. I am confident that I will have no problem working with my fellow committee members and
  that we will succeed in overseeing a successful election year. In addition, I believe in taking my responsibilities seriously,
  and being a member of this committee would be no exception. Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
