  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I am currently a Senior at Queens College completing a Psychology major business minor and Judaic studies minor with a 3.9
  GPA. I transferred last year from Rutgers University primarily so that I could join leadership organizations like this one. I
  joined UP last year and ran for academic senate where I was elected as the Junior-Senior representative. I am now the Vice Chair
  of Advertising and Promotions in the Student association. I am very interested in how the undergraduate curriculum, admissions
  requirements and scholastic standards are devised and how they can be improved and changed. For myself as a transfer student I
  think its very important that this information is dispersed. I am also very interested in how the undergraduate technology fee
  is applied and utilized.</p>
