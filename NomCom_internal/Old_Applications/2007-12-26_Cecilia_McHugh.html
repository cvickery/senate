  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I would like to serve in the Search Committee for the Dean of Mathematics and
  Natural Sciences I have been a P&amp;B representative for the Queens College School of Earth and Environmental Sciences since
  1998 and have participated in at least 10 faculty searches for the department. I have also served as Assistant to the present
  Dean Thomas Strekas since 2003 and have experience in the matters of the Dean's Office. I would like to serve in this Search
  Committee because I have experience in both departmental and Dean's office matters and I think I can contribute to the
  Search.</p>
