  <h2>Other Committee Requests:</h2>

    <li>Subcommittee on Honorary Degrees (Student applications only)</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I feel that as a member of the college I need to help in whatever way I can. I am
  a hard worker and responsible individual. I think that my different schedule ranging from morning to night and weekday to
  weekend scheduling qualifies me to attest for the different types of groups found in the school. I feel that I can help improve
  the scholastic standards in the school based on my experience in the different atmospheres the school has to offer. The general
  campus life has not been a strong point for most CUNY's including Queens College and I'd like to try and help in any way I can
  in these areas.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>The search or review committee could use people to help out and improve the
  system. I feel that it would require a lot of work and I'd love to help out if I could. I am pretty consistent with my work and
  do the best in what I do. I am responsible and would be able to help out where necessary.</p>
