  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>As the Director of the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship program, I have been
  fortunate enough to recruit and surpevise students that are interested in pursuing PhDs in designated Mellon fields. The MMUF
  program allows me to choose the best students on campus through a rigorous interview process and a thorough review of their
  file. In addition to running the Mellon program, I served for two years on the academic senate and for the past 4 years, I have
  been an alternate delegate of the PSC-CUNY Queens chapter. I believe through all of these activities, I have acquired enough
  experience to serve on the College Committee on Honors and Awards.</p>
