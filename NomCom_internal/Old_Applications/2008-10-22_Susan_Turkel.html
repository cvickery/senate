  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am willing to serve on the search committee for the Dean of Education. I have
  been an assistant dean, chair and a long time faculty member. I also have experience serving on the Dean's five year review.
  This experience has given me insight into the qualities necessary for productive leadership. As an active member of the
  Divisional Assessment Committee and my department's assessment committee, I am aware of the importance of our upcoming NCATE
  review. I believe that a new dean should be capable of organizing and leading us through this review process. In addition, a new
  dean should be committed to urban education, research and teaching.</p>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Search committee for the Dean of Education. Please see the above paragraph for my
  reasons and qualifications.</p>
