  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Dear Hi, I am so interested in Academic senate committee since I want to be more
  involve in my beloved college and in order to know how college works and seeing that how students from the senate work for their
  fellow students and finally apply those lesson to my knowledge and my life to be better. The major reason why I want to be a
  part of it is I will be more responsible for my being than I am now. I will be a great privilege that I am recognized as a
  student of Queens College Senate Committee. Because of this, not only would I study harder than I am, but I also would behave in
  more confident and accountable way throughout my college life. Additionally, I will be more partcipated in a program from QC.
  Also, I want to help students who are in need by addressing a policy which suits for him or her. From my experience, one of my
  fellow classmates from Academic Senate, helped me to know the fact that a student have a right to dispute a final grade with a
  professor and should be known why the student deserved it. By using my righr as a student, I fortunately disputed and changed my
  final grade. I was an awesome experience for me. I think now is the time to help a student who has a similar circumstance with
  me. I want to pay back the favor from my former classmates, Yitzchak Lockerman. I would be appreciated if I would have an
  opportunity to be part of Queens College Sanate Committee. I appreciate for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Hyochon
  Lee</p>

  Environment Committee</p>
