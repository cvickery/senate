  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am currently a second semester Freshman and I strongly believe that I should
  not simply coast through college. This campus and it's academics affects me in a great deal and I want to make a difference in
  at least a part of how things get decided. As an Emergency Medical Technician, I have dealt with many different and stressful
  situations successfully and have been able to resolve manage said situations. I am currently intending to further my medical
  aspiration and pursue Pre-med. Although I am undeclared, major-wise, last semester I took three social science classes including
  two political science classes and I really developed a very strong interest in politics. Although I will not take up Political
  Science as a major, I would like to get active in the local politics of my campus. A member of campus clubs such as GLASA and
  The Political Science Club.</p>
