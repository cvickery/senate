  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have been a part of the Queens College Community and the Elementary Education
  department in a number of different capacities for 12 years. I began as a graduate student in 1996, became an adjunct in 1997,
  and in 2000 became a full time faculty member. In 2004 I was granted the CCE as a Lecturer, and intend to apply for a
  tenure-bearing professorial line on completion of my doctoral degree. Throughout my years here, I have served on departmental,
  divisional, and college-wide committees and, for the past year, I have worked for the CUNY Central Office on the CUNYfirst
  project. I am back on campus this year with an even stronger commitment to EECE, the Division of Education, and Queens College.
  Finding a strong academic scholar and administrator who can lead the Division of Education is vitally important to the future of
  the faculty and students in EECE, SEYS, and ECP. I feel that I can be an effective contributor to this Se! arch Committee.</p>
