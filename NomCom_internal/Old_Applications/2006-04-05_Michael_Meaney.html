  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I was recomended to the committee by Colette Golinski, Director of the ACE
  program, in which I am enrolled. This committe monitors standards for QC students by reviewing individual cases in question.
  Being a member of the Vestry of my church, as well as head of several committees there (including Christian education), I
  believe with an open mind, I can review work being done by the USSC and help in making fair decisions on petitions. I have
  served as Vice President of the board of the Josephine Foundation, raisng money for childrens services. MY experience with
  procedure will serve myself and the committe well. I attended a meeting of the USSC on 4/5/6 and believe I can be an asset.
  Thank You, Michael Meaney</p>
