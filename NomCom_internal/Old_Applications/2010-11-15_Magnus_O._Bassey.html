  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I have served as a member of the Internal Student Affairs Committee since 1998. During the 2004/2005 academic year, I served
  as the committeeâ€™s chairperson. Indeed, over the years we (as a committee) have taken many decisions affecting the welfare of
  international students at Queens College in particular and at CUNY in general. Also, as a former international student myself, I
  am in a good position to understand the problems confronting international students and to work to help resolve them.</p>
