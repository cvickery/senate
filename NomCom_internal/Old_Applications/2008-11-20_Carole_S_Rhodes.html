  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>For the past decade, I have been actlvely involved in the lntegratlon of
  technology In teaching and learnlng. I have publlshed papers and presented both research findlngs and practical applicatlons of
  technology integratlon for National and International professional groups. I try to mode1 "best practice" for my students as we
  develop eÂ·portfolios and prepare podcasts use PDA's In educational settings. I serve on the Division of Educatlon and the SEYS
  Department technology Committees. I think that my experiences and expertise would be beneficial to the committee.<br />
  NOTE: This is a copy of Prof. Rhodes' PDF application to serve on the Tech Fee Task Force. She indicated by email that she is
  also interested in serving on the Technology and Library Committee, but that TFTF is her preference.</p>
