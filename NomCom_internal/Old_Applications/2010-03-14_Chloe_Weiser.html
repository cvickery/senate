  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>The reason I am applying for the Campus Environment Standing Committee is because
  I have an extreme passion for nature and the environment. In my personal life I am committed to the proverbial phrase "Reduce,
  Reuse, and Recycle" and I would like to spread that mantra throughout Queens College by educating people of opportunities
  available on campus and elsewhere to help preserve the integrity of Mother Nature, and by creating additional policies and
  opportunities that contribute to green living. I have a ton of ideas to assist Queens College in becoming more environmentally
  friendly. Right now I think it's important to work on improving the campus food service packaging situation (reducing existing
  waste, perhaps creating reusable packaging or packaging that is at least recyclable; in addition, recycling as much as possible
  using existing recycling programs by raising awareness of them). I feel that I am academically and intellectually inclined for
  this position because I am a University Scholar belonging to the Macaulay Honors College. I maintain excellent academic standing
  with a GPA of 3.83, and am on the Dean's List. Thank you for considering me.</p>
