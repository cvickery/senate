    <li>Elections</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Other Committee Requests:</h2>

  <p>None</p>

  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I would like to serve on the Elections Committee for the following reasons: As former student body president at Queensborough
  Community College (QCC), I too had to go through an election process, which at QCC differs greatly from the elections process at
  Queens College (QC). I am confident that my experiences at QCC can help me make recommendations to the Elections Committee that
  will help improve that way in which elections are conducted at QC. Furthermore, I would like to serve on the Elections Committee
  because I feel that it is the duty of the Elections Committee to inform students of the electoral process at QC, an important
  duty I hope to push for if elected to the committee.</p>
