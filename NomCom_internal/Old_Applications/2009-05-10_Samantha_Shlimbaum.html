  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am already active on campus and well known by administrators, staff and
  students due to my involvement in many clubs. I was Board Representative for New York Public Interest Research Group(NYPIRG) for
  2008-2009 and am re-elected for 2009-2010 semester. My work through NYPIRG has helped me ascertain my public speaking skills. I
  am also an active member of the political science club and executive manager of Democratic Student Alliance and next year will
  be treasurer of the history club. I chose Campus Affairs as one of my committees because I a want to enhance campus life at
  queens beyond the classroom. I chose Special Committee on Technology and Library because I feel the library's print system needs
  to be updated for coming years.</p>
