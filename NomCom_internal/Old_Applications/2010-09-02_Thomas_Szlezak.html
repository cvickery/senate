  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>As a Student Aide at the Academic Advising Center and an alum of the Peer Counseling Program, I have run across students of
  academic situations that run the gamut. My experience in dealing with these different populations and thorough understanding of
  the current curriculum would help me to assess the current and future curriculum for undergraduate students. As a current
  alternate senator and prospective administrator in higher education, I believe that a strong curriculum can be of value to every
  student. Through the Advising Center, I've also assisted with the welcoming of new students from the Admissions office, who
  despite coming from different backgrounds, must all meet the same general requirements upon graduation. I am also willing to
  serve on the Special Committee for Technology and Library. I feel Queens College has much to do to keep up on the cusp of
  technology, and to make all its technological resources more fully available to the large (and growing) population. The library
  on the other hand, is a powerful resource that not many students really seem to take advantage of. The priorities of these two
  resources need to be discussed and revised.</p><br />
