  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I have been an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department since Fall 2009. In this time, I have led courses at
  Queens College in which there were academic conflicts. I believe that I handled these fairly to all involved. These experiences
  left me with additional respect for the processes surrounding academic policies and resolution of conflicts. I believe I can
  contribute positively to discussions of these conflicts and of related academic policies moving forward.</p>
