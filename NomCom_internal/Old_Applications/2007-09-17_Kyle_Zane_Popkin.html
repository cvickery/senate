  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am currently a sophomore, but am 1 credit short from being a junior. This past
  spring semester i was part of the political party that had won, and won a seat as the upper sophomore/ lower junior senator.
  Since then i have gotten to know a wide selection of faculty members. I am looking to expand my involvement on campus by being a
  part of the Academic Senate. I am very knowledgeable in Roberts Rules of Order, and am currently trying to learn the Academic
  Senate Bylaws. I am serving as the coordinator for the Freshman / Sophomore committee and Multicultural Affairs Committee in
  Student Association. I am the president of this college's Inter Greek Council, and I'm an active member in 3 other clubs. I am
  the Treasurer of a Greek Organization on Campus. If i do get to sit on the nominating committee, I promise that i will do
  everything that is in my power to get the job done. I also am well aware of what this job entails, and am prepared to meet a
  challenge, if any were to arise.</p>
