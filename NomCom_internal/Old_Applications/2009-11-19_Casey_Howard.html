  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I served as Student Council President my senior year of high school as well as
  Yearbook Creative Director and President of Senior Class Affairs. As part of my job as Student Council President I oversaw all
  the other clubs within the school and helped in every event and election. With Senior Class Affairs, I was the major liaison
  between the senior class and the administration. This year I am currently Public Relations Manager for the Campus Affairs
  Committee, Treasurer for the Charities Committee, as well as Content Manager for the Yearbook. I believe that I can effectively
  make decisions and follow through on tasks. I am concerned with fairness in all procedure and committed to excellence.</p>
