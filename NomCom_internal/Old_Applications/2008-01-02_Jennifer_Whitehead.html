  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am interested in serving on the search committee for the new Dean of the
  Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. I have been a member of the Computer Science department at Queens College since
  1980. I have served on the department P&amp;B since 1988. I served one three year term as chair of the department (2003-2006)
  and have served as deputy chair since then. While chair of Computer Science I also served on the College P&amp;B Executive
  committee and on the search committee for the Assistant Vice President/Chief Information Officer. As chair of Computer Science,
  I had many opportunities to work with the current Dean of DMNS and gained an appreciation of the importance of his work, both in
  the vital day to day management of the division, and in planning its future growth. The next Dean will have a major role in
  shaping the future direction of the College in the Sciences. It would be a privilege to serve on the search committee.</p>
