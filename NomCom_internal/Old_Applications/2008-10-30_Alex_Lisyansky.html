  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am nominating Prof. Alex Lisyansky, chair of the Physics Department, for
  membership on the Provost Search Committee. As chair of Biology, I have worked with Prof. Lisyansky for over 5 years, both
  serving on the Division of Math &amp; Natural Sciences caucus. I am very impressed with his Prof. Lisyansky's academic insight
  and am confident that he will be an excellent representative for the sciences on this extremely important search committee.
  Under his leadership the Physics Department enhanced its academic programs for science and nonscience undergraduates, hired
  several top rate new faculty members, and expanded the Department's research and scholarly activities. Prof. Lisyansky interacts
  with the Provost regularly and is quite knowledgeable regarding the role of the Provost in the advancement of the College. He
  has served on the Committee of Seven, the College-Wide P&amp;B Subcommittee on the Budget, and has been deeply involve! d in the
  reorganization of the science doctoral programs and their integration at the College. In this last capasity, Prof. Lisyansky
  worked with the Provost, the Dean for Research and Graduate Studies, the Dean of Math &amp; Natural Sciences, and the Chairs and
  College's Deputy Executive Officers of the Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Physics Departments to get the newly
  reorganized doctoral science programs established and active at the College. Overall, I am confident that Prof. Lisyansky
  understands what the College needs in the new Provost and has the perspective and vision to contribute significantly to the
  selection process.</p>
