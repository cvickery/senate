  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>My name is Selene Munoz. I am currently a Junior/Senior Senator, a Queens College
  Student Ambassador, and the Administrative Assistant of the Political Science Club. I enjoy working in areas of politics and
  decison-making. I feel that being part of the process is great exprience in order to learn, feel, and truly absorb the reality
  of circumstances in all areas. This is the reason I would like to serve on the Elections Committe. I would like to learn,
  experience, and contribute to the elections procedure not as a candidate but as one who supervises and estagblishes procedures
  of the Academic Sentate and the Faculty Student Disiplinary Committe (FSDC). I was part of the FSDC the last academic year and
  during the spring 2005 we were faced with a situation. I enjoyed serving as the student member, being able to represent and
  contribute my ideas and opinions. Thank you very much for the time and opporunity. -Sincerely, Selene Munoz (Below you will find
