  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>As a new senator of the Academic Senate, and as a dedicated, intelligent, and focused student, I can positively contribute to
  the crafting of the academic calendar, as well as specific campus wide events, which I strongly think need improvement in many
  aspects. As for the Special Committee on Governance, I would love nothing more than to work with the Charter, Bylaws, and
  Standing Rules of the Senate. Our senate mimics the workings of any federal or state senate in many ways, and to be involved in
  the review of the senate procedures, and ensure their efficacy, is something I would immensely enjoy.</p>
