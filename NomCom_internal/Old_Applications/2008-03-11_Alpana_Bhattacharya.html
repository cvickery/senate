  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am currently a tenured assistant professor of Educational Psychology in the
  Secondary Education and Youth Services department (SEYS). At the present time, I serve on several SEYS department and Education
  Unit Committees. I am (1) an Elected Member, SEYS Personal and Budget committee, (2) the Nominated Coordinator, SEYS Educational
  Psychology Core Program, (3) the Appointed Chair, SEYS Curriculum Committee, and (4) a Member, Education Unit Assessment
  Committee. In the past, I have also served a 2-year term as a Nominated Member of the Academic Senate. My representation on
  various department and Education unit committees, I believe, qualifies me to serve as on the Dean of Education Review Committee
  of the Academic Senate.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am applying for the Dean of Education Review Committee.</p>
