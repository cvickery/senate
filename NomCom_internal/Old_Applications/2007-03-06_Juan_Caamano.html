  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I kindly request to serve on the Undergraduate Scholastic Standards Committee,
  which is organized to uphold and review the policies and procedures governing academic standards and consider student appeals
  accordingly. As Queens College alum, I value first-hand the mission for which the College was created: to offer a strong liberal
  arts education to working class people. I am an immigrant; I am the first with a college degree in my family; and my
  relationship with Queens College spans 18 years. I understand the hardships facing our unique student body. In addition, my
  scholarly work and experience outside of Queens College have allowed me to see the need for motivating our students to higher
  excellence. I have an interest in how the College can leverage scholastic standards to significantly improve student success.
  This semester I will hold a graduate student symposium to afford students the opportunity to extend their acade! mic performance
  to a public sphere. I would equally like to see undergraduate students also held to higher expectations. I understand and
  respect students’ time constraints and family obligations, but I mentor my undergraduate students to raise the bar on what they
  consider a strong resume so that they can compete for the best graduate programs or excel in the job market. The success of our
  students is not only personally rewarding, but ultimately benefits the college. My service to the Committee would involve
  balancing empathy for the student and a commitment to the standards that will ensure that a QC degree continues to be held in
  high regard.</p>
