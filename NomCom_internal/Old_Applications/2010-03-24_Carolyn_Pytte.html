  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have had a great deal of experience mentoring exceptional Queens College
  undergraduates conducting research in my laboratory in the area of Behavioral Neuroscience, and I would find it inspiring to
  recognize the outstanding achievements of students across the campus. I currently serve on the Psychology Department Master’s
  Advisory Committee, General Master’s Admissions Committee, Neuroscience Majors Admission Committee, am Chair of the Master’s in
  Behavioral Neuroscience Admissions Committee, serve on the Academic Senate, as well as numerous graduate grants and awards
  committees within Psychology and Biology. However, I do not have experience with undergraduates across departments and am very
  much looking forward to having broader exposure to the accomplishments of students across divisions.</p>
