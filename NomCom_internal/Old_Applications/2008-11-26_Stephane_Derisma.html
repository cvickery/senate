  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am currently a member of the Elections Committee. I would like to continue
  being a member on this committee. My experience in the last election has greatly helped enhance the quality of the election on
  this campus. I am actively invovled in this committee and have yet to miss a meeting. I would like to renew my membership and
  contiune to serve as the an election committee member. I believe that my experience as a running candidate will help shape
  online election and elections on this campus better. In addition, I am a member of GLASA and an alternate senator for the
  Democratic Student Alliance. I believe that my presence in this body will contiune to bring equal representation since the
  alternate senators don't get to cast their votes at the senate meeting. By renewing my membership, the alternate senators will
  have a voice in the electoral process through this body, and mostimportantly give the students of queens college ! a voice by
  making the election process fun for all.</p>
