  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am interested in serving on the Teaching Excellence and Evaluation Committee
  for a number of reasons. I believe that teaching effectiveness can increase considerably with a conscientious approach and
  frequent re-evaluation of pedagogical techniques. Being a non-native speaker, I am aware of the difficulties that students
  experience during classes taught by professors with a foreign accent. Through my years of teaching I have been developing and
  revising techniques to improve student comprehension of course material, to improve the clarity and structure of my classes, and
  to increase interaction during class time, as well as outside of the classroom. Counting my appointments during graduate school,
  I have nine years of teaching experience. I have been teaching at Queens College since the fall of 2002.</p>
