  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have been a member of the Teaching Excellence and Evaluation Committee for two
  years and currently serve as the Committee's Chair. We have much work to complete on the initiatives which we have just
  introduced, including online course evaluations, and I would like to continue to move these initiatives forward. My PhD training
  in psychology included training in questionnaire administration, and I have designed multiple questionnaires myself. In
  addition, I serve as one of my department's Master Teachers and Instructor Trainers, and have received a Queens College
  Presidential Award for Excellence in Teaching.</p>
