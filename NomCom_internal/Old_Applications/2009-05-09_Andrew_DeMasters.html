  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am an active student on campus who is willing to fight hard for the students.
  Currently I was elected as Alternate Senator for the Upper Freshman/ Lower Sophomore Class of Queens College. I was recently
  elected Treasurer of the Political Science Club which sponsors close to 40 events per year. These events enrich the lives of
  students at Queens College. By allowing me to serve on one or more of these committees, I will work hard with fellow committee
  members to make progress and enrich the lives of all Queens College students. I would prefer to serve on the UCC because the
  LASAR requirements are changing to PLAS requirements which will affect many incoming and transfer students. Thank you, Andrew
  DeMasters</p>
