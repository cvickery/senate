  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I wish to continue to serve on the Special Committee on Technology and the
  Library (TechLib). I have been an active member of this committee for several years now, and find the work we do fulfilling. I
  will be on sabbatical during the spring 2009 and spring 2010 semesters. I have asked a colleague, Scott Walters (LCD), to serve
  in my place during the upcoming spring 2009. He has agreed, and has submitted an application for that position. I hope the
  Nominating Committee agrees that this is a sensible way to fill the Arts &amp; Humanities faculty seat, in my absence --- should
  the Nominating Committee, logically, consider me worthy of continuing on as member of TechLib.</p>
