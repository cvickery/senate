  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I have had much experience regarding libraries and their recent evolution to the use of computerized materials. I am the
  co-creator of Social Explorer, which was named a best Reference Source in 2010 by the Reference Users and Services Association
  of the American Library Association. Due to this and my involvement in promoting that resource, until distribution was recently
  taken over by Oxford University Press, I have a good grasp of library trends. I personally have made extensive use of the Queens
  College Library for my own work.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p>I would be happy to serve on the review committee for the chief librarian.</p>
