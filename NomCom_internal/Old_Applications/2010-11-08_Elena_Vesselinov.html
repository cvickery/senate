  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I would like to continue to serve on the Graduate Scholastic Standards Committee. I am a member of the Sociology Graduate
  Faculty at CUNY, have worked and continue to work with graduate students. I believe that graduate education is particularly
  important in the context of increasing globalization and the current economic crisis and think that I am qualified to serve on
  it. I also enjoy my work on the TechLib committee and would like to continue as a member of that committee, as well. The
  constantly changing technology and communication methods should be well incorporated into the QC resources. As a faculty in
  Social Sciences I believe that the committee should work towards facilitating the use of technology for faculty and
  students.</p>
