  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am greatly happy to be a Queens College student. I have first started my
  freshman year by pledging Alpha Epsilon Pi. This experience really has helped shape what I am capable of doing and the limits I
  have as a person. My limits are non-existent. Whatever I have ever strived to accomplish has been a success and hopefully this
  habit with continue. Ever since joining AEPi, I have also won the position as a freshman/sophmore serving on student senate. I
  was also elected as the Parlimentarian of the student senate. After applying for the above position of my request, I hope to
  learn more about myself and serve the students to the best of my capacity to do so. Thank you for the oppurtuntiy.</p>
