<h2>Statement:</h2>
<p>I have been working in Higher Education as a full time tenure-track/tenured professor for the past 16 years. First at The George Washington University and then Northwestern University, where I was the Director of the Dance Program, and now here at Queens College. As Director of the Dance Program at Northwestern I helped facilitate a complete overhaul of the Dance Major Curriculum, and worked closely with the Registrar's office in this task. I am particularly interested in Education and Teaching (I hold an Ed.D in Dance Education from Temple University) and am committed to the ideals of a liberal arts education. I care deeply about the students' core education and how it relates to critical thinking skills across disciplines. I am also deeply committed to the art of teaching and interested in helping foster an environment where excellent teaching is the center of what we do.</p>
