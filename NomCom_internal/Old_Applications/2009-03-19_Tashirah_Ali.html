  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I would like to serve on the Search Committee for the Dean of Education. I would
  like to help with the Search Committee for the Dean of Education because my professor suggested that I join. The idea of helping
  to find suitable candidates for education programs at Queens College seems like it would be an interesting process to witness
  and be a part of.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am applying for the Search Committee for the Dean of Education. The coordinator
  of the Counselor Education Program asked me to join this committee. I think he asked me because I am very proactive and like to
  be a part of anything I can be. I am also very dedicated to doing my best and representing Queens College while doing so.</p>
