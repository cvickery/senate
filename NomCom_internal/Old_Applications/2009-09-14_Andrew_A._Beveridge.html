  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I would like to server on the review committee for Dean of Social Sciences,
  Elizabeth Hendrey. For the past three years as chair of sociology I have worked closely with Dean Hendrey. I believe I have a
  good grasp of her abilities as Dean to work with a broad set of constituencies at Queens, including students, staff, faculty
  (adjunct, full-time, lecturers, GTF's), as well as elements of the Queens community. I also have had experience with her working
  with the President and Provost's office. I have been at Queens College since 1981, and have been chair of sociology since 2006.
  I have a graduate center appointment and am an active researcher.</p>
