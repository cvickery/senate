  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am a junior at Queens College, a media studies major and I have a 3.0 gpa that
  I plan on increasing this semester. I am involved in the Jamaica Bulldogs cheerleading and football team, a active member of the
  Christ the King youth Group, a choir member of Christ the King Youth Choir, and a active member of the Campus Affairs Committee
  at Queens College. My qualifications for this committe are literally everything I am involved in, each has given me the
  leadership skills, guidance, and determination. Each has made my outlook on life positive and gave me a keen eye for seeing
  leadership in others and how dedicated people are to what they believe in. Since I myself stand for so much, it's impossible for
  me to fall for anything. I am interested in serving on the nomination committee because I am concerned about who is part of the
  student government at my school. The only way for myself to assure that all the best of the best are selected is for me to be
  part of the selection process. Another reason is, because i want to be a publicist. An opportunity for me to on board of
  choosing leadership, gives a test drive of what I will be doing as a career. I must be capable of weeding out the good from the
  bad. Lastly, I want to be on the nomination committee because it is an opportunity for me to learn more about my school's
  student government and all the offers it has.</p>
