  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Having served on the Undergraduate Admissions and Re-entry Standards Committee
  (CARS) for one year, I found it to be a very gratifying experience. The amount of dedication and effort that both the
  faculty/student members and staff have devoted to reviewing 150+ appeal applications is inspiring. Additionally, to help the
  re-admitted students complete their degree requirements, the Committee has worked with the Admissions Office, Counseling, and
  other offices to implement a number of changes in the reentry procedure. I would like to continue to serve on CARS. Thank you
  for taking the time to consider my application.</p>
