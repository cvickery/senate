  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>As a full-time faculty member in the Elementary and Early Childhood Department, I have served on the departmental Honors and
  Awards Committee for three years. My service on this departmental committee has given me valuable experience that qualifies me
  for the College Committee on Honors and Awards. As a member of the EECE departmental Honors and Awards Committee, I have
  experience reviewing undergraduate applications for criteria addressing the academic and social accomplishments of students who
  have desires to become teachers in urban classrooms. I feel that I can bring this experience and the perspective of a
  teacher-educator to the College Committee on Honors and Awards. At the same time, I can broaden my professional experience and
  service to both the college and its students.</p><br />
