  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am applying to be a member of the Search Committee for the Dean of Education. I
  feel that I would be an asset to that committee for the following reasons: 1. I am on a National NCATE (Educationâ€™s accrediting
  body) Board and therefore am in a unique position to know what our new Dean must know and be able to do since we are up for
  re-accreditation in fall 2010. 2. I have served as a Department Chair at another university and know how and in what ways a
  Dean, Chairs and faculty must work together. 3. I had been offered a Deanship and fully understand the roles, responsibilities
  and requisite skills required for of the position. 4. I believe that faculty and administration should work together to provide
  continuity but also move the Division of Education forward.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Search Commitee for Dean of Education. I am a tenured Full Professor in Secondary
  Education and Porgram Direct for the Secondary Literacy Education Program. I have previously served on the Senate Executive
  Committe at two other universities.</p>
