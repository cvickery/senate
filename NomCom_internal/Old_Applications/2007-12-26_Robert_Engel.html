  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I wish to serve on the upcoming Search Committee for the Dean of the Division of
  Mathematics and the Natural Sciences. I have been a faculty member here since Fall 1968 and have taken a major interest in the
  development of the Division and entire College as well as my own Department. I feel it is critical that we choose an incoming
  Dean for the Division who will provide the continued leadership for the development of the Division and College as a major
  constituent of CUNY, as well as the development of each of the Departments within the Division to their fullest extent
  possible.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am applying for the currently being formed Search Committee for the Dean of the
  Division of Mathematics and the Natural Sciences. My qualifications and reasons have been stated above.</p>
