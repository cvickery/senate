  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Dear Chris Vickery: I am willing to serve on the Academic Senate Executive
  Committee -- but it is not listed as one of the choices above. I spoke to Dean Savage who suggested that I choose "special
  Committee on Governance" and then send this explanatory note to you. Qualifications: I have a long standing interest in
  governance in the College and the University. I served on the Queens College Academic Senate Executive Committee in previous
  years -- from 1998-2003 and I am currently serving as a member of the University Faculty Senate (UFS), which I have been doing
  since 2003. I have and continue to serve on the UFS Committee on Technology and Libraries since 2003 as well.I am also serving
  on a University Committee -- the Committee on Academic Technology.</p>
