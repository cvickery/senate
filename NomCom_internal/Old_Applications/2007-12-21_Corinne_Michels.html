  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I wish to serve on the Search Committee for the Dean of Mathematics and Natural
  Sciences. I have been Chair the Biology Department for the past 7 years and, as such, interact with the Dean of DMNS
  extensively. As a result, I believe I have a clear picture of the qualifications for the position and the type of individual
  that would advance the interest of this Division and the College. During my tenure as Chair of Biology, the Department has hired
  over 15 people to the tenure-track professorial ranks (10), instructor/lecturer (2), a Research Associate for our Core Facility,
  and college laboratory technicians (4). Additionally, before becoming chair I served on several other search committees for the
  Biology Department and the College (Dean of Graduate Studies and Dean of DMNS). This extensive experience provided me with an
  astute ability to judge the character of an individual and whether they will serve the Division in a col! laborative and
  collegial manner.</p>
