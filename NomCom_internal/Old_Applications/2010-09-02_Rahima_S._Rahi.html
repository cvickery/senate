  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>I am a BA/MA student with a 3.7 gpa in Philosophy. I am currently working on my master's thesis. I am currently writing for
  the school news paper "The Knight News" in the feature section and also contributing for the layout section. I am also an active
  member of the Philosophy club where we as a group organize events those will help the Philosophy major student and others to
  know more about Philosophy and learn to think analytically. I hold a supervising position in a Medical office billing department
  where I have been working for past five years. These experiences have given me the opportunity to gain much administrative
  knowledge and skills, also the satisfaction of being able to get involved in the school and be able to contribute what I have
  learned by serving in different way. The reason I am interested in Campus Affairs and Campus Environment because I have always
  been in some kind of campus affairs in my entire college career and now I would like to take this opportunity to serve as a
  committee member. I think all of us should be environmentally conscious person because it affects each one of us very much. I
  believe, I am doing my part to protect the enviornment in my daily life. However, I would not want to miss any opportunity to be
  able to serve in a position which regards to the awareness of protecting the enviornment. My interest on serving in the special
  committee on governance is something that comes from my interest in Law and the legal field. I plan to get a combined degree on
  JD/PhD in Philosophy which will lead me to the career of Jurisprudence. Though it is not as related to the committee position
  however, I see myself serving the people of my community as an attorney/advocate. And today I feel, by being in the committee on
  Governance in my School will give me a little chance to serve for my fellow schoolmates. Therefore, I would like to take this
  opportunity to contribute to the committee and serve for the Queens College community.</p><br />
