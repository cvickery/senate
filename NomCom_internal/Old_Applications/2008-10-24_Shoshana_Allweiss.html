  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am a born leader. I enjoy leading and have acted as a leader throughout High
  School and now in Queens College. I am not only involved in a variety of committees in Queens College, but I am a Freshman
  Mentor. Most importantly I am the President of the Student Friends of the Rosenthal Library Club on campus. This position allows
  me to be informed about the issues that students deal with in terms of the library, and to be aware of the wonderful assets that
  the library has to offer the students of Queens College. I utilize Queens College's website and other technology availabilities
  because of my position as President of a club on campus and also because of my mentor position. Since I am very involved in
  Queens College Campus Life I feel that I am qualified to represent the student body on the Academic Senate Special Committee on
  Technology and Library.</p>
