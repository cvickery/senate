  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>From my understanding this is a very crucial committee to be a part of and I think I can be a great asset to it. I took part
  in student elections in high school, and I know how competitive people can get. By being in this committee I think I can make
  sure that everyone stays under control and no disorderly conduct occurs. I know this is a nuetral position and that is why I
  really hope to be considered because I would like to see how both sides work.</p>
