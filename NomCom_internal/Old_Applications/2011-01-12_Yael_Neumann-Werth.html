<h2>Statement:</h2>
<p>I have served as a faculty member and undergraduate advisor (Division of Arts and Humanities, Department of Linguistics and Communication Disorders) at Queens College for 4 years, and thus am familiar with both matriculated and non-matriculated student concerns. I am also Chair of two departmental committees aimed at analyzing the pre-requisite courses and other requirements for admissions to Queens College (LCD department) as compared to other colleges in the Northeast, so I have a background in issues related to Admissions. I look forward for the opportunity to serve on the Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and Re-entry Standards (CARS). Thank you, Yael Neumann-Werth</p>
