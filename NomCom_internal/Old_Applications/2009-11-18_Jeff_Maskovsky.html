  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am well aware of the extraordinary level of commitment that UCC participation
  requires, and I believe that I can bring the pre-requisite experience to this position. I serve on the General Education
  Advisory Committee, served on the General Education Task Force Areas of Knowledge Working Group, and participated in the June
  2007 Institute on PLAS Course Development. While serving a two year term as Acting Director of the Honors in the Social
  Sciences, I worked closely with the UCC and with Dean Hendrey to revamp the program. I served as the Urban Studies Departmental
  Representative to the faculty senate from Fall 2002 to Spring 2005, and I teach regularly in the Honors College. I also chair
  the Urban Studies Departmentâ€™s curriculum committee. Through these activities, I have gained a keen sense of the major
  curricular issues facing the College. I would come to the UCC with expertise on new experimental pedagogies, academic program
  development, outcomes assessment, and general education. And I have a good sense of the broad, ecumenical approach to curricular
  development and review that is necessary to serve effectively on the UCC.</p>
