  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am currently a Senior, earning my Bachelor of Arts in English and Political
  Science at Queens College. Early in my college career, I demonstrated a strong commitment to the college by founding the
  Italian-American Society at QC. While bearing the challenge of a new club, I also served on the executive board of the
  Philosophy Forum. By the end of sophomore year, I already completed a successful semester interning at the State Senate in
  Albany, NY for Senator Joseph Griffo. During my internship she drafted a Paternity Leave Act for the state of New York, which
  was later introduced to the Senate by the Governor. Presently, I am the elected President for the Democratic Student Alliance
  and serve as an alternate senator for the Academic Senate at QC. While juggling academics, and interning for Congressman Gary L.
  Ackerman, I have also welcomed new students as an orientation leader this past summer. In the Fall of â€˜08, I am al! so
  participating in Model United Nations. I would like to continue helping students from my learned experiences at QC.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I respectfully ask to be considered for the A&amp;H Dean Five-Year Review
  Committee. As an English and Political Science major, I have first-hand knowledge of the Arts and Humanities. I understand the
  needs of students at QC in this field and would like to be their advocate by serving on this committee.</p>
