  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>As a full-time faculty member in the SEYS Department for five years, I believe I
  am qualified to serve on the Search Committee for the Dean of the Division of Education. I served on the Search Committee for
  the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research in 2007 and was also the Senator At-Large representing the Division of Education in
  the QC Academic Senate from 2006-2008. I am interested in serving on this important committee because as a faculty member in the
  Division of Education, I have a vested interest in our leadership and future as a Division. I want to help ensure that we find
  the most qualified, knowledgeable person for this position and am aware of the hard work that this committee will require of its
  members. Thank you.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am applying for the Search Committee for the Dean of the Division of
  Education.</p>
