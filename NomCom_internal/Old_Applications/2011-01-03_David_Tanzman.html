<h2>Other Committee Requests:</h2>
<p>None</p>
<h2>Statement:</h2>
<p>I am a hard worker in everything I do as evidenced by my high GPA. Furthermore, I have good critical thinking skills which will allow me to be a positive addition to the committee. My strong code of ethics will enable me to apply the school’s policies both fairly and professionally. Being on the committee would also provide me with the opportunity to give back to the students of Queens College. The responsibilities of the Undergraduate Scholastic Standards Committee, in particular, interest me because the decisions made by the committee may have a significant impact on student’s academic careers.</p>
