  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I would like to be on the Elections Committee because I have experienced both
  kinds of the elections that took place at Queens College: Online and Ballot election. I believe that my experience and my
  knowledge on the Queens College student government and senate electoral process would enhance the electoral process at Queens
  College. There is a false allegation against me that I was the DSA campaign manager when in fact, I never was. I have done
  everything by the book. I want to be in the Elections Committee because I am sick and tired of the student behaviors during the
  election week. Since I am about to graduate, I want to do something that's right and appropriate. For me, my goal is to serve on
  this committee. Please consider my application. Thank you much for your time. DEAr</p>
