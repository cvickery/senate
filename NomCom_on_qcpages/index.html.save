<h2>Application for Committee Membership</h2>

  <p>You may submit a committee membership application to the
  Nominating Committee by submitting <a href="./Application.html">an
  application form</a>.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you may download a copy of the Membership
  Application Form from the link below, print it, fill it out,
  and then submit it to the Senate office, Kiely 810 either in person
  or by mail. You may also submit a completed form to the Senate
  office by fax to (718) 997-5884, but we prefer receiving online or
  printed copies because they are generally more legible.</p>
