  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am a senior at Queens College as an English major and a women's studies minor.I
  am a SEEK student and will represent the SEEK department in the Academic senate of the Student Association. I have been an
  active participant in various organizations throughout my high school and college years. I was the co-founder and President of
  the Muslim Club in Bayside High School. Also, I was the treasurer of the MSA at Queens College. In addition to my participation
  in organizations, I studied abroad during the semester of Spring 2007 in Winchester, England. I had the opportunity to travel to
  8 European countries and was exposed to various languages, cultures, and peoples. I believe students' experiences, both social
  and learning, is vital and I am very much interested in participating in the Academic Cirriculum Committe. My strong leadership
  qualities will enable me to contribute to the Student Association and help bring any necessary changes or improvements that will
  benefit the students.</p>
