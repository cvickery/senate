  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>At first hearing about this committee, i was skeptical about joining. Though,
  later speaking to members of this committee, i had a want to join it. Even though my major is Anthropology, i do have a love in
  Technology and also the library. I am always intrigued to read and learn about new technology that is coming out. I am currently
  a Junior and my GPA is a I 2.5 and therefore i am in good standing. I am part of other committees, as well as clubs here on
  campus. I would like to help out more, especially when it comes to something i am interested in. I am well aware in how a
  meeting goes, and i believe that i would not hinder the meeting.</p>
