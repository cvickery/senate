        The <em>Ad Hoc Committee on Pathways</em> was created by the Senate to develop the
        Queens College implementation plan for the CUNY Pathways initiative. The committee
        expired on April 1, 2012 when the College’s plan was approved by the Senate and
        submitted to the Chancellor.
        <p>
          The committee maintained a forum where anyone could follow the committee’s
          deliberations, and any member of the Queens College community could ask
          questions and make suggestions.  That forum continues to be available for
          archival purposes: <a

          about the committee’s work, including an archive of documents related to the
          process of developing the colleges implementation plan.
