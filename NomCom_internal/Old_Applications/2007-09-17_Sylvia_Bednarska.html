  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I'm in my third year on campus and I have been involved in student life for some
  time now, and would like to broaden my college experiences and involvement. I am a double major in Anthropology and Elementary
  Education, I have maintained a high GPA (currently at 3.96). Currently, I am a member of Student Association cabinet, serving as
  a coordinator on the Campus Affairs Committe. I feel like this position and my overall involvement with student government makes
  me a qualified candidate for a seat on one of the Academic Senate committees. I would specificaly like to be on the
  Undergraduate Curriculum Committee because I feel I could adequately represent the needs of the student body. By having a double
  major I have experience in more than one academic field and feel that I could make a significant contribution to the Committee
  and the decision it makes. Another reason why I am interested in this committee is that I have some concerns and ideas that I
  repeatedly came across throughout my years at Queens College that I would like to see addressed.</p>
