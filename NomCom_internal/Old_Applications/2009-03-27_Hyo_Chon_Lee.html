  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Hi. This is Hyo Chon (Paul) Lee; an international student from South Korea. I am
  a lowered junior, double-majoring in Psychology and Computer Science,and minoring in BALA. I am interested in those committee,
  in particular, I would like to serve internatioanl student affairs committees to help them have an equal opportunity. For
  instance, despite the fact that international students pay tuition almost twice than a the U.S citizen-student, they do not have
  an opportunity for applying a scholarship. I would like to discuss and negotiate with the administration as a representative of
  international students. Secondily, the reason I choose Undergraduate Scholastic Standards is to participate in constituting or
  changing a policy for academic standards. I would like to study and develop grading policis with representatives. In addition to
  these two committees, I also want to participate in Nominating committee. In order to elect an eligible representative
  confidentially, I would like to help fellow students to be fair and dot get them biased. I will do my best and I will take all
  my accountabilities to represent my committees. Moreover, through this great opportunity, I would like to strenthen my capacfity
  to strech my being at my beloved collge. Thank you Sincerely Hyo Chon (Paul) Lee</p>
