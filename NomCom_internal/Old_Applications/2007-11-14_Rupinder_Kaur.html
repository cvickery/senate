  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am qualified to serve the committee because I will put all my time and effort
  to make sure we have reviewed everything to have the appropriate vote. Also, working at the president's office for over a year
  and taking six classes has made me a better and organized student. I want to help others. I belong to the ALPFA, NYPIRG
  organizations. Also, very soon I will be starting my own club. It is being approved and we are doing the paperwork. I am very
  detail oriented, organized and ready to work. I always put my heart into the work. I think about others before I think about
  myself. I want to improve our school and help others get their degrees.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I want to apply for the Undergraduate Scholastic Standards committee. I was
  recommended by David Leventhal.</p>
