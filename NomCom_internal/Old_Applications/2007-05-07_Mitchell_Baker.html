  <h2>Other Committee Requests:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em;'>None</p>

  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I teach introductory biology and ecology. I would greatly like to improve
  sustainability education on campus, which will include very low-impact projects, such as a student garden, which will need to be
  located using this committee, to longer term and more involved projects such as electrical outlets in the parking lots for
  plug-in hybrids, better and more secure bicycle parking, and ultimately renewable power projects. This committee doesn't control
  any large projects, but can be a useful voice.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have been a Natural Sciences academic senate member in the past, though my
  appointment lapsed this year. I look forward to serving in 2007-2008, and beyond.</p>
