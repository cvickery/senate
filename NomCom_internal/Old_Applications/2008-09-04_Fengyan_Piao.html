  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I came to Queens College with the ambition for achieving qualified and
  challenging education. I first started getting involved with Queens College Ambassador program. I gave group tours to propective
  students and I was proud to introduce Queens College. I have been on the Dean's list from Freshman year and I was also listed on
  the Honors Roll. I'm currently majoring in English and minoring in BALA and Studio Arts. The study abroad programs in United
  Kingdom and Japan have widened my experience as a student and as an invididual. As a peer counselor, I strongly want to get more
  involved with the college. Thank you for consideration. Sincerely, Fengyan Piao</p>
