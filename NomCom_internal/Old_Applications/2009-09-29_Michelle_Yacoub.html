  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>At first, I was only going to apply to be on the committee for search and review
  for the Dean of Mathematics and Natural Sciences because the Dr. Atrzt, the Director of my program, Time 2000. Nominated me to
  apply. After looking over everything I realized that would love to be apart of these committees and have a small say as to how
  Queens College is run. I am passionate about the school and think I fit in fairly well with the beliefs and mission of Queens
  College. I think I would be a good student representation. I am a receptionist manager at my current, part time job, which
  entitles dealing with all sorts of individuals and helping my manager screen through applicants. I am also the Chief Editor of
  the Time 2000 Newsletter. I actively tutor and just joined and participate in clubs, such as NYPIRG and CAC. I also believe that
  time is not going to be an issue in regards to attending all of the committee meetings. The reason I chose the committees listed
  above is because nothing makes a college more besides its students than its professors and the community environment. Students
  know teachers best because we sit in class with them, learn from them and experience them on a level that is most important to
  their position at a school. I feel like I would be a great help with teacher evaluations. Also, campus affairs really makes the
  college environment. The way I usually describe Queens College is the perfect balance of academics and recreation. I would love
  to help keep it that way. I am currently a lower junior and my GPA is about 3.8. If chosen I promise to do the best I can.</p>

  <h2>Additional Comments:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am applying for the search and review committee for the new Dean of Mathematics
  and Natural Sciences. I am a Mathematics Major and I Minor in Secondary Education and Economics. There is nothing more important
  to me then to make sure that the new Dean can live up to standards set by faculty and by the student body. Having a Dean that is
  approachable, understanding and definitely wise beyond years is important to me, especially in the department of my Major.</p>
