  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I am very interested in serving on the technology and library committee. I have
  been involved in higher education as graduate student and faculty for over 12 years now and consider access to library and
  technology resources as essential for conducting successful research and teaching. I also have discussed this opportunity with
  Dean Savage and he recommended that I apply to be a member of the committee. I am also willing to serve on other Senate
  committees, such as the graduate or undergraduate scholastic standards committees and the nominations committee. Thank you for
  considering my application.</p>
