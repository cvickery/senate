<h2>Statement:</h2>
<p>I feel that I am qualified for this position because I am the kind of person that stands up for what they believe, and can back-up their belief with facts. Being an undergraduate college student I do not think anyone else would understand the troubles and issues of an undergraduate student than someone who is in the position. I also understand that with time and circumstance our rules and regulations need to change. These changes cannot be made only by people who have not been in college in a very long time. I feel that our college curriculum should reflect the needs, and wants of what we (the students) have to face in the coming future. In order to prepare for the future we need to ready ourselves in the present, and our education requirements should reflect the kind of future we want.I would like to be one of voices that reflect positive changes that prepare us for the future.</p>
