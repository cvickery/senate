  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p>Serving on the Academic Senate Committee gives voice to the students. Hard working, motivated, and dedicated students express
  and explain the needs of the whole student body - a student body which (I find) to be the most diverse out of any other college
  near by. Students who live near and far come the study at Queens College; ask at least 10 students you see on campus and ask
  them what languages they know how to speak and I guarantee that at least half of them will know another language other than
  English! Queens College is surrounded by cultures from all over the world, which is one of the things that make our school so
  great! I myself have studied in China, and when there the students at Sichuan University were so welcoming and the course I took
  was carefully created by the staff. Such nice gestures I encountered when studying at another school doesn't only reflect the
  kind hearted people, but also the image of the school. And so I have chosen to become a member of the International Student
  Affairs Committee because of my love of culture and to show those studying abroad at Queens College just how great of a school
  we are!</p>
