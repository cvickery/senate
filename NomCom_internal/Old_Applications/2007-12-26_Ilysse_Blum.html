  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>Having served as the sole student representative to the recently completed Search
  Committee for CUNY's Vice Chancellor for Faculty/Staff Relations (now Vice Chancellor for Human Resources Management and Vice
  Chancellor for Labor Relations), and to the Spring 2007 QC Search Committee for Assistant Provost, I feel extremely confident in
  my ability to serve as a member of the Search Committee for the Dean of Mathematics and Natural Science. In addition to serving
  on the aforementioned Search Committees, I have served Queens College, both on a campus, and on a CUNY-wide level in the
  following capacities: CUNY Board of Trustees Committee on Faculty, Staff, and Administration, sole student delegate; University
  Student Senate representative; Queens College Student Association, Executive Assistant and Academic Chair; and QC Undergraduate
  Curriculum Committee, student representative. Along with having sat on a host of other campus-! wide committees, including the
  Auxiliary Enterprise Association, and the SU Finance and Budget Committee, I have come into contact with a wide variety of
  students, and faculty, and as such, feel most equipped to assess the needs of the campus community moving forward in the
  Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. I would very much like to bring this brethren of knowledge that I have acquired
  through my involvement on campus to the Search Committee for the new Dean of MNSCI. Thank you very much for your
  consideration.</p>
