  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I have volunteered for a variety of departmental and college -wide committees in
  my first 4 years at QC in order to gain a complete understanding of how the college functions, both for my personal knowledge
  and so I can help my students to benefit from all the support that QC offers. For the past 2 years, I served on the Scholarship
  committee and came to fully understand the selection process and criteria. This has enabled me to identify and mentor deserving
  students who were not aware of these internal oportunities. Now, as a follow-up to that experience, I would like to serve on the
  Honors and Awards Committee in order to learn how to help students pursue opportunities for formal recognition that will enhance
  their future career and graduate study prospects.</p>
