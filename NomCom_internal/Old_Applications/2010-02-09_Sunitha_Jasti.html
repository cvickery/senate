  <h2>Statement:</h2>

  <p style='margin-left:2em; margin-right:10em;'>I'd like to serve on International Student Affairs committee. I came to the US as
  a graduate student from India, and appreciated very much the support from the universities (VA Tech, and UNC-Chapel Hill)
  available to international students and how they made our transition to higher education in the US easier both on and off
  campus. I was active in Indian Student Association activities and also took advantage of events organized for international
  students and in the process made wonderful friends from all over the world. I'd love to contribute towards that process here at
  QC. I also served on the senate as an at-large representative for school of Mathematics and natural sciences.</p>
